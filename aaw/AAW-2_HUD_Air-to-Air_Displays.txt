Anytime the TD box is limited by the HUD field of view, a dashed target
locator line is displayed. The target locator line extends from the
waterline symbol and points to the limited TD box. The off-boresight
angle is displayed next to the limited TD box, and represents the target
angle off boresight in degrees (Figure D-3). (In this and remaining
displays, the elimination of the heading, bank scales and pitch ladder
indicates that symbols reject has been selected.)

As you close, the ASE circle increases in size. Placing the steering dot on
the circle will cause you to close on the locked target to 500’ separation.
Where you put the dot is where the target will be in the HUD (Figure
D-5).

Radar AUTO Acquisition

As you have previously learned in RDR-3, the selection of a particular
radar auto acq mode depends on the situation encountered. The auto
acquisition scan pattern (except for GUNS) selected is graphically
presented in the HUD. The HUD auto acquisition displays assist the pilot
in maintaining the target within the radar scan until radar lock on. Once
lock on occurs, regardless of the method with which lock on was achieved,
the track display presented on the HUD (and radar display) is a function
of the weapon select switch position (FCP, right throttle).

HUD WEAPONS DISPLAYS & STEERING

AIM-7

Representative AIM-7 attack mode displays are shown in Figures D-6 and
D-7. For these displays, symbols reject has been selected and the master
arm switch is in ARM (gun cross displayed 2° above the waterline). When
radar lock on occurs, the 12° MRM reference circle is removed, and the
ASE circle, steering dot and TD box appear on the HUD.

Figure D-6 shows two AIM-7 MRMs available with a 7M in priority. The
uppermost number on the range scale is the selected radar range. Vc
(closure velocity) is left of the caret. The caret position on the range scale
is PDT range. Priority missile launch range boundary data is displayed
on the range scale. The data block in the lower right corner of the HUD
contains the following information (in order):

Target (PDT) altitude is presented in thousands and hundreds of
feet (16-2 = 16,200 feet). Aspect angle is presented in degrees L/R
(15L=150° left).

Radar cues (JAM = Jamming present).

PDT radar range (R 11.3) is presented digitally.

Priority missile (under the pickle button) time of flight (TOF) to the
PDT (T12 sec = AIM-7 TOF is 12 seconds) is displayed when PDT
range is between Raero (current) and Rmin.

In-flight missile time information showing minimum/maximum
times to impact (TTD if more than 1 missile is in flight. T2/T10 sec
equals 2 sec and 10 sec until impact for previously fired AIM-7

missiles.

times.

If another onboard weapon is in the envelope for the current attack
geometry, that missile cue flashes adjacent to the priority MRM inventory.
In this case, an AIM-9M is the off missile and three SRMs are available.

Should the radar experience a signal loss during track, the track memory
and reacquisition logic is activated. The MEM cue appears on the HUD
and the TD box flashes (MEM also appears on the radar display) while the
radar extrapolates the last known target position and velocity. When
signal loss/degradation is due to ECM devices, the jam code (AOJ, HOJ,
JAM) overrides all other displays in this window.

If a valid signal return is received during this sequence, the radar
reenters normal track. If not, the radar returns to search. If radar track
is lost after missile launch (or if the target moves beyond the missile
limit), LSG (Losing) is displayed in place of missile TOF.

Text from AAW-2_HUD_Air-to-Air_Displays_page_16.jpeg:
AIM-120

The HUD (and radar display) AIM-120 presentations are determined by
the radar mode of operation. The launch modes are visual and radar
track.

Visual

This mode is used for visual range engagements. If, for instance, an
AIM-7 is in flight, with another one under the pickle button, the pilot can
thumb forward on the boat switch (missile reject) until an AIM-120 is in
priority. Holding the coolie switch down informs the missile that it is
being launched against a boresighted target (i.e., within the 12° reference
circle) with range and velocity unknown. No data link is provided to the
missile. Care should be used when launching an AIM-120 in the visual
mode since any close range aircraft along the missile boresight is a
potential target.

Radar

Figure D-8 shows four AIM-120s available with an AIM-120A in priority.
If two AIM-120As and two AIM-7Ms are carried, A2A is displayed when
an AIM-120A is in priority and M2M when an AIM-7M is in priority. The
dashed ASE circle replaces the AIM-7 solid ASE circle and mirrors the
radar display. AIM-120 shoot cue (and the lock/shoot light) criteria and
display logic parallels AIM-7 logic. The CC will generate an AIM-120
shoot cue with the radar in STT or DTWS, assuming all other
preconditions have been satisfied.

Text from AAW-2_HUD_Air-to-Air_Displays_page_17.jpeg:
Next to the MRM inventory (Figure D-8) is the target size/RCS (radar
cross section) settings as programmed in the PACS for MRM missiles.
Refer to 1F-15E-34-1-1 and 1F-15E-34-1-1-1 for more details about target
size/RCS settings. The off missile cue has display priority over the target
size/RCS settings.

The data block below the radar range scale reflects AIM-120 information
similar to the AIM-7 display. If target range is within the computed
Raero (current) and Rmin, prelaunch time to active (TTA) appears on the
HUD in place of missile TOF. If range to target is less than active range,
the time displayed is time-to-impact (TTI) and is prefixed with an “H” if
the missile will launch and immediately go to HPRF active, and with an
“M” it will go MPRF active. At launch, MRM quantity changes, and the
TTA begins countdown on the next lower line on the HUD. If more than
one missile is launched, the TTA cue reflects the minimum/maximum
TTA/TTI of any missile(s) in flight. (Post launch TTA/TTI is added to the
radar display.) Off missile cue logic is the same as for the AIM-7.

When the last MRM has been launched, the MRM count goes to zero to
indicate no missile available. The ASE circle is removed, and only the
steering dot (based on MRM computations) is displayed. The shoot cue is
also removed (Figure D-9).

Radar in Track

After radar lock on, the FOV circle is replaced by an ASE circle and
steering dot. The AIM-9M ASE circle size is constant regardless of SCAN
selection. Centering the dot provides pure pursuit steering. When range
is greater than 12,000 feet, an aspect line (stick) is present on the ASE
circle. When target range decreases to 12,000 feet or less, a circular range
bar appears inside the ASE circle. Range is read on the bar according to
clock position (7 o’clock equals 7000 feet range). Rmin LC and Rmin HC
bars reflect Rmin for the missile and repeat the Rmin LC and Rmin HC
displayed on the radar range scale.

The AIM-9M seeker in priority is slaved to the radar LOS. Thus the
seeker head position circle and TD box are coincident (Figure D-12).
There may be transient periods in which the two LOSs are not coincident,
particularly during high-G maneuvers.

When the radar is supporting an AIM-7/AIM-120 in flight, the pilot can
boresight the AIM-9M if desired to engage a visual target. If boresighted,
the AIM-9M ASE circle (replaced by FOV circle) and steering dot are
removed, and the shoot cue is not displayed (Figure D-14).

If the SRM is already in self track, you must first cage the seeker to the
radar LOS (via the NGS button), then move the coolie switch down and
hold to boresight the missile. If the coolie switch is released before the
missile is uncaged (self track), the seeker returns to the radar LOS (TD
box).

The FOV circle flashes when the radar antenna approaches gimbal limits.

GUN-A/A DISPLAYS

Figures D-16 through D-19 present the four possible HUD displays that
you will see when selecting GUN on the weapon select switch. The
displays are lead computing optical sight (LCOS) search funnel, LCOS
track funnel, gun director sight (GDS), and GDS funnel. Radar track and
funnel selection status impact which display will be seen.

Air-to-air gun employment and the combined SRM/Gun displays will be
covered in the gun lecture (AAW-6).

Symbols unique to the GUN attack HUD are the funnel, reticles, rounds
at target range (RATR) cue, bullet maximum range (BMR) cue and rounds
remaining numerics. The gun cross is present in the HUD with the
master arm switch in ARM.

LCOS Search Funnel

Figure D-16 shows the LCOS search funnel gun aiming display. This
display is in the HUD when GUN is selected on the weapon select switch
and the radar is in search. The funnel is used to help align in plane with
the target to achieve a stable tracking state.

Text from AAW-2_HUD_Air-to-Air_Displays_page_25.jpeg:
The three pippers (2-mil circles) are located at pseudo target ranges of
1000, 2250, and 4000 feet (with PGU-28 in PACS). The width of the
funnel at each range is determined by the apparent size of a 40-foot
wingspan aircraft located at that range (stadiametric ranging). Ifthe
target aircraft is tracked in the funnel with one of the pippers on the
target, and if the target is visually judged to be at the pipper defined
range, then the bullets should pass through the target.

The RATR cue is present to show the location of your bullets arriving at a
pseudo target range of 2250 feet (1000 feet if in stiffen). The RATR is
present from arrival of the first bullet until arrival of the last bullet in the
fired stream of bullets.

The numerical rounds display indicates the approximate number of
bullets on board as programmed in the PACS and not yet expended.
During gun fire, the HUD (and PACS) count of rounds remaining
decreases ten at a time (i.e., 220...210...200... etc.). The last number in the
rounds remaining count in the HUD will be a “T” if the PACS is in the A/A
or A/G TRNG mode (i.e. 51T). When all rounds have been expended, the
rounds remaining count will show XXX (or XXT when in training PACS).

ownship maneuvering parameters. The funnel is also moving based on
the same data. If the pipper is held on the target in a stable tracking
situation, the bullets should arrive at the target one time of flight after
trigger squeeze.

The range bar is provided to show radar derived range in an analog “clock
type” format. The bar starts at twelve o’clock and moves clockwise. The
leading edge of the bar shows range by clock position in thousands of feet,
e.g., 3 o'clock is 3000 feet range.

The 2-mil pipper/50-mil reticle/turn plane line are dynamically positioned
based on ownship maneuvering and target range/range rate/maneuvering
data. Ifthe pipper is on the target at trigger squeeze, bullets should hit
the target.

The radar range analog bar and RATR work as previously described. The
range bar has a leading edge tab.

The BMR cue is a dot positioned at the perimeter of the 50-mil reticle to
indicate maximum effective bullet range based on type of rounds loaded in
the PACS and ownship/target maneuvering and relationship. Like the
range bar, a BMR dot at 3 o’clock would indicate a maximum effective
bullet range of 3000 feet, 4 o’clock, 4000 feet, etc.

The BMR cue indicates the range that corresponds to a bullet TOF of 1.5
seconds for the M-56 bullet or 2.5 seconds for the PGU-28 bullet, or an
impact velocity of 500 FPS, whichever produces the shortest range.
Maximum accurate firing range is attained when the range bar tab is
equal to the maximum range cue.

The TD box is removed when its center is within 25 mils of the pipper, and
target range is less than 3000 feet (or the maximum bullet range,
whichever is greater). It reappears when range increases to 3200 feet (or
200 feet greater than maximum bullet range), or when the center of the
box is more than 37 mils from the pipper.

SYSTEM DEGRADES
CC Failure

All MRM and SRM computer generated attack steering display data is
lost if CC failure occurs. A shoot cue is not provided, and launch
envelopes must be estimated. The fixed MRM 12° reference circle is
continuously displayed, and provides a visual aiming symbol for a missile
fired without radar lock on. STT is available on the radar. If an AIM-7 is
launched in STT, HPRF illumination is provided for 120 seconds. The
AIM-120 can not be fired.

The AIM-9M seeker head reference circle is not displayed, and the
missiles are boresighted to 0° azimuth and 46 mils below the gun cross.
The seeker heads will not slave to the radar. The waterline can be used as
an aiming reference. When the missile in priority is uncaged, no cues will
appear in the HUD to show uncaged and track status.

The gun cross is continuously displayed, and becomes the sole aiming
reference for gun shots.

PACS Failure

The CC relies on inputs from the PACS for computation and display of
specific weapons aiming information. This includes the ASE circle and
steering dot, launch range boundary data, missile and bullet inventories,
etc. Therefore, with PACS failure, all ordnance-related HUD data is
absent.

INS Failure

INS failure should not cause any degradation of HUD weapons displays
other than a flashing velocity vector, as the AHRS provides automatic
backup of INS attitude inputs. However, the unlikely failure of both
systems could be mistaken for selection of symbols reject on the HUD. In
either case (symbols reject or attitude failure), the heading and bank
scales and pitch ladder are removed. Keep in mind, though, there will be
many additional indicators of complete attitude failure.

MPDP Failure

Failure of the MPDP results in loss of the HUD.

TEXT

The HUD is the primary reference in the visual, dogfight environment. In
conjunction with the FCP stick grip and throttle controls, the HUD affords
the distinct advantage of in-close radar acquisition and A/A weapons
employment without looking inside the cockpit.

Although an indispensable tactical tool, there can be drawbacks to this
“single-source” attack, navigation and attitude display. One potential
danger is pilot fixation on attack symbology to the exclusion of other
environmental cues like flight path convergence with terrain, the target
aircraft, etc. Channelizing attention on the HUD at the expense of a
disciplined crosscheck is too often a fatal error.

The HUD display is limited in A/A information when the NAV or INST
master mode is selected. The TD box is the only A/A type symbology in
the normal NAV or INST HUD displays. Target and missile information
is not available except on the radar display. These master modes are not
recommended for A/A employment.

A/A information is not available in the A/G master mode except on the A/A
radar display.

HUD DISPLAYS-A/A MASTER MODE
A/A Master Mode Selection

The HUD displays are governed by the selected master mode. HUD
air-to-air weapons displays are only available in the A/A master mode.
Depressing the A/A master mode button, moving the FCP castle switch
forward (if not in A/A), or selecting GUN with the weapon select switch,
immediately selects the A/A master mode. Subsequent forward movement
of the FCP castle switch will toggle between A/A and A/G master modes.
While in the A/A master mode, the HUD attack displays are then
determined by the weapon select switch position (AFT/CTR/FWD).

SNIFF (SNF) and VIS IDENT (VI)

There are a number of radar modes that influence what information is
presented on the HUD. You will recall that the SNF and VI modes are
selected by pressing the buttons adjacent to those options on the A/A
radar display. The SNF cue is displayed on the HUD (Figure D-1) when
the radar is operating in this mode.
