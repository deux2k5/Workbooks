Text from ACG-1_Aircraft_Introduction__Cockpit_Overview_page_10.jpeg:
Academic lectures are presented in the 333 FS classroom or Eagle
Academics classrooms (classrooms 1, 2, and 3). Computer-based training
(CBT) blocks are accomplished in the Learning Center upstairs in the
333 FS. Integrated Avionics Trainer (IAT) lessons and cockpit
familiarization trainer (CFT) lessons are done upstairs in the 333 FS.
Weapon system trainer (WST) missions are completed in one of the
simulator buildings (building 4400 or 5006).

NONE

There is no formal ACG phase review in the F-15E syllabus.
However, individual instructors are available to answer questions

and assist in reviewing ACG material. Please do not hesitate to ask
them for help.

Using the syllabus flowcharts and daily schedules as a guide, you should
always know what is coming next in this course. The major responsibility
for learning the material is yours. The instructors can assist; however,
you must do the learning. This is especially true in the avionics block
with most of the instruction being CBT lessons. Classroom, flight and
trainer time is limited; to get the most out of these devices, it is essential
that you complete all preparatory steps before going to the event.
Instructors will present material to you and field your questions. If you
are unsure of anything in this course, ASK!

F-15E ROLES AND CAPABILITIES

The F-15E is a high performance, supersonic, all-weather, dual role
fighter.

The air-to-ground (A/G) role tasking includes both conventional (general
purpose and precision guided munitions) and nuclear strike. The term
“all-weather” means the F-15E can penetrate and deliver ordnance in or
under the weather.

The air-to-air (A/A) role tasking may include self-escort and air base

defense. The design mission definitions specify relatively long station
times and excellent dash and turning capabilities.

ACG-1 D-4


Text from ACG-1_Aircraft_Introduction__Cockpit_Overview_page_11.jpeg:
Configurations, Range, and Capabilities

The dual role mission requires superior payload/radius characteristics,
payload loading flexibility, high speed sea level penetration capability,
and superior combat maneuverability. The performance of the F-15E
provides over 1000 nm mission radius, a 600 KTAS penetration, 4 Gs
sustained maneuvering at MIL power and 6 Gs with afterburner.
Instantaneous evasive maneuvers up to 9 Gs at gross weights of 68,000
lbs are achievable at sea level.

In the A/G role, the payload/radius of the F-15E is enhanced by the
capability to carry up to 35,550 lbs of fuel and by the low drag associated
with the tangential carriage of weapons on the conformal fuel tanks
(CFTs). A mission radius of 680 nm is achievable with a payload of four
MK-84s and four AIM-120s (advanced medium range air-to-air missile or
AMRAAM) including a 100 nm sea level dash. At MIL thrust, it can
achieve sea level dash speeds of 590 KTAS without external tanks and
550 KTAS with tanks. Nuclear strike mission capability is almost 1100
nm (tanks dropped). The F-15E has 19 integral store stations, the
potential for 24,500 lbs of payload with full internal fuel, and eight
stations for A/A missiles. This provides the field commander the flexibility
to match payload and radius to the requirements no matter what the
theater of operation.

In the A/A role, the maneuvering performance is equal to that of the
F-15C at subsonic speeds and increased at supersonic speeds.
Instantaneous maneuvering is enhanced by increasing the design limit
load factor to 9 Gs. The A/A mission performance is substantial. For
theater air defense with a payload of eight missiles, the F-15E can loiter
on combat air patrol (CAP) for up to 3.7 hours at 200 nm from base. For
the area intercept mission, the radius with eight missiles is 967 nm.

In the ferry mission, the F-15E has sufficient range to deploy worldwide
without tanker support. Range with full external fuel and four AIM-120s
is approximately 2200 nm.

Design Philosophy

The F-15E is the product of a technically low risk attempt to satisfy a
USAF requirement for a survivable deep interdiction aircraft. The
rationale was to exploit capabilities already existing in the F-15 by
modifying them only to the extent needed to provide the ability to
penetrate and accurately deliver weapons in all weather, day or night.

D-5 ACG-1


Text from ACG-1_Aircraft_Introduction__Cockpit_Overview_page_12.jpeg:
Relatively minor changes were required to the airframe and basic
systems. Substantial cockpit changes were required to fully exploit low
altitude navigation and targeting infrared for night (LANTIRN) and
decrease crew workload to the extent that the dual role could be
accomplished. Many of the “changes” in the F-15E were already approved
for the F-15A/C and reflect refinements of operational systems rather than
new developments.

The cockpits were designed to reduce and simplify crew tasks. Workload
is minimized by using multiple displays (multipurpose displays [MPDs],
and multipurpose color displays [MPCDs]) for simultaneous display of
sensor, weapon, and advisory data without requiring extended sequencing
through display selections. Color displays are provided for easier
interpretation of data. An integrated upfront control (UFC) is included in
each cockpit for operation of aircraft communications, navigation and
identification (CNI) systems. Hand controllers permit rapid changes of
mode, selection of display options and sensor/weapon management.
Display units are within easy reach and, along with other cockpit
instruments and caution/advisory indicators, are situated for easy
viewing.

Operation from any MPD/MPCD uses prompting menus for sensor modes,
submodes, and advisory formats. The cockpit controls, instrumentation
and displays are integrated to provide virtually unlimited flexibility in the
use of the systems.

Extreme cockpit flexibility requires extensive crew coordination. Crews
must have a plan to ensure everything gets done without duplicating
effort.

F-15E ENHANCEMENTS

LANTIRN

The LANTIRN system consists of two pods, which provide night,
all-weather low altitude navigation and precision targeting information.

The LANTIRN system provides the following capabilities:
e Terrain following radar (TFR)
e Forward looking infrared (FLIR)

e Day/Night target detection, identification and designation

ACG-1 D-6


Text from ACG-1_Aircraft_Introduction__Cockpit_Overview_page_13.jpeg:
e Target acquisition and track
e Automatic target handoff to Maverick missiles

A radar altimeter is integrated into the system for both automatic terrain
following and hand flying operations.

F100-PW-220 Engine
The F-15E is powered by the F100-PW-220 turbofan engine. This engine
replaces the F100-PW-100 engine used in earlier F-15 models. In
comparison, it is easier to maintain, more responsive, has a longer life,
and is computer controlled to provide maximum performance throughout
the flight envelope. F-15Ks, starting with tail number 90-0233 and up,
have the F100-PW-229 increased performance engine (IPE).
Tactical Electronic Warfare System (TEWS)
The TEWS consists of the following electronic warfare systems:

e ALQ-135 internal countermeasures set (ICS)

e ALQ-128 electronic warfare warning set (EWWS)

e ALR-56C radar warning receiver (RWR)

e ALE-45 countermeasure dispenser (CMD) set
Inertial Navigation System (INS)
The INS is a self-contained, fully automatic ring laser gyro (RLG) system
that supplies the primary attitude reference for the aircraft and provides
continuous present position (PP) monitoring. You can do a stored heading
alignment in 40 seconds or a full alignment in 4 minutes. It is accurate to

approximately 0.8 nm/hr., has reliability of 2000 hours mean time
between failure (MTBF), and can operate on emergency generator power.

D-7 ACG-1

APG-70 Radar A/G Functions

The APG-70 high frequency, pulse doppler radar retains all of the A/A
modes and capabilities of the F-15C, but includes many new A/G modes.

Improved A/G modes are incorporated to provide the necessary long range
precision cueing of the LANTIRN targeting pod. These modes are
implemented through software changes. The new modes are: high
resolution map (HRM), real beam map (RBM) and precision velocity
update (PVU).

High Resolution Map

The HRM mode provides the most accurate long range designation and
LANTIRN cueing capability. Resolution varies from 8.5 feet to 1014 feet
depending on the size map and range selected. This feature is not
available within 8° of the aircraft velocity vector; it is otherwise available
over the limits of the plan position indicator (PPI) scan.

Real Beam Map

The RBM mode permits rapid mapping of large areas. RBM permits
mapping along the velocity vector and provides backup targeting pod
cueing capability against large discrete targets. RBM provides the crew
with an indication of gross terrain features along the flight path to aid in
low altitude navigation. Additionally, the antenna manual elevation
control coupled with the pencil beam antenna pattern provides excellent
weather detection.

Precision Velocity Update

In the HRM mode, coherent doppler processing uses aircraft velocity to
display target returns at correct azimuth position. LANTIRN’s narrow
field of view requires velocity accuracies of less than 1 fps when
designating targets from radar maps at 10 nm or greater. The PVU mode
is used to determine a more refined estimate of ownship velocity than that
provided by the INS.

ACG-1 D-8


Text from ACG-1_Aircraft_Introduction__Cockpit_Overview_page_15.jpeg:
Missionized Cockpits

Both cockpits are arranged to enhance situational awareness and reduce
workload. The front cockpit includes two 6-inch MPD, one 5-inch MPCD,
a UFC, an integrated engine monitor display (EMD), and a wide field of
view head-up display (WFOV HUD). The rear cockpit has two 6-inch
MPDs, two 5-inch MPCDs, and a UFC. This allows both crew members to
view data best suited for that specific mission segment. Either crew
member may view a display format in command by the other crew
member.

COCKPIT FAMILIARIZATION

The F-15E maintains the basic F-15 hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS)
philosophy for the front cockpit, and provides it in the rear cockpit too.
The crew interface eliminates many traditional control panels by
integrating the system functions, via software, into the display formats.
For example, instead of having a radar control panel to select elevation,
scan, range, mode, etc., the functions are now integrated within the A/A
radar display format adjacent to push buttons, which are arranged around
the perimeter of each MPD/MPCD. The operational technique is the same
for both front and rear cockpits.

Additional cockpit familiarization is covered by the instructor in class.

Also, refer to foldouts 5 and 7 in the Dash 1 and the handout section of
this workbook.

Multipurpose Display Group

There are few dedicated controls and displays in the F-15E cockpits. Most
systems are accessed and their output and/or indications are displayed on
a MPD or MPCD (Figure D-3). MPDs and MPCDs are functionally
similar, except A/G radar cannot be displayed on MPCDs.

Text from ACG-1_Aircraft_Introduction__Cockpit_Overview_page_17.jpeg:
MPD/MPCD

The MPD/MPCDs and associated display processors provide flexibility to the
crew. The MPD/MPCDs have 20 peripheral push buttons by which the crew
controls aircraft/systems and the mission data to be displayed. For
convenience, these push buttons are referred to by number using the
numbering convention shown on Figure D-3 (for example, PB #1). Menu items
are positioned adjacent to each push button to advise the crew of the modes
and options selectable for operation. In addition to the 20 push buttons, each
MPD/MPCD has three rocker switches and one BIT indicator. Their
functions, except for the BIT ball, are the same as the similarly labeled
switches on your home TV set. The BIT ball turns white to warn of internal
system failure. Color coding of display data on MPCDs aids in quick
interpretation of complex formats such as an electronic HSI and ADI. Color
presentation of navigational maps also contributes to easy assessment of the
tactical situation.

Wide Field Of View Head-Up Display

In addition to being the “gunsight,” the HUD (Figure D-4) displays
information critical to flying and employing the F-15E. Primary HUD
displays include: aircraft attitude, AOA, current/available G and a flight path
marker called the velocity vector. Through the selection of different master
modes (A/A, A/G, NAV, Inst), the HUD also provides steering information for
various navigation and weapons delivery displays. In addition, the HUD has
the capability to display LANTIRN FLIR video for night operations. A HUD
repeater is available on any front or rear cockpit display.

Upfront Control

There is a UFC (Figure D-5) in each cockpit. The UFCs are used as the
input/output control for most of the F-15E avionic systems/functions. By
design, the UFCs take the place of conventional avionic switch panels
found on other aircraft.

Each UFC has 10 option push buttons located along the sides of the liquid
crystal display (LCD) screen. The screen consists of six 20-character rows.
The top four rows display menu/submenu options and data. The fifth row
displays UHF manual frequency data. The sixth row displays preset
channel selections and in the “scratchpad,” data that has been entered via
the keyboard. UHF preset channel select knobs are located adjacent to
the corresponding scratchpad display. UHF volume control knobs are
located below the respective channel select knobs.

Text from ACG-1_Aircraft_Introduction__Cockpit_Overview_page_20.jpeg:
To select a function or submenu, ensure that the scratchpad is clear and
depress the button that is adjacent to the desired function or submenu.
To change data in a UFC controlled system, type the new data into the
scratchpad with the alphanumeric data keys and depress the button
adjacent to the option to be changed.

Other special function keys are listed below:

GREC C/M - permits selection/deselection of the UHF guard receiver and
selection between a preset channel or manual UHF frequency.

MARK - used to select and store present position latitude and longitude.

A/P - used to engage the autopilot and command display of the autopilot
submenu.

I/P - initiates IFF identification of position (I/P)
SHF - permits shifting to the uppercase alphanumerics.

CLR - used to clear the scratchpad of miskeyed or unneeded data. The
first depression removes the last alphanumeric entry and the next
depression clears the entire entry. If the scratchpad is clear, the first
depression clears the top four display rows. The second depression clears
the bottom two rows. This blanking feature is designed to be used during
night operations as a way to eliminate UFC light reflections on the
canopy. To recall all display rows, depress the MENU or DATA button or
one of the top eight option buttons.

EMIS LMT - when depressed, turns off all IFF modes and stops all RF

transmissions except for the radar altimeter and the TF radar, which
switches to the low probability of intercept (LPI) mode.

ACG-1 D-14


Text from ACG-1_Aircraft_Introduction__Cockpit_Overview_page_21.jpeg:
Although you will need a thorough working knowledge of the UFC, it is
designed so memorizing submenus is not necessary. If “lost” in a
submenu, remember:

e Pressing Menu 1 or Data 1 returns you to a starting reference.

e Regardless of the display option selected, UHF frequency data is
always displayed on rows five and six. With a blank scratchpad, the
UHF submenu can be accessed from any display/submenu by
depressing PB #5 or #6.

e The scratchpad must be blank in order to change a display or to
select another option, except to elect Data 1/2 or Menu 1/2.

The UFCs design allows avionic systems control from either cockpit. The
UFC menus/submenus can be accessed from either cockpit at the same
time. However, for data entry the individual entering the data must be
the one who typed it into the scratchpad. The last aircrew input,
regardless of cockpit, is the entry that is accepted.

ADMINISTRATION
Security

Much of what you will study here is classified material. Care in
safeguarding this material is required to prevent compromise.

The administrative specialist will issue classified materials to you during
the first two weeks of the course. You must log this classified material
into the squadron student safe, located in the weapons shop.

Once signed out, the classified materials are your responsibility. NEVER
leave them unattended. Studying classified material is authorized only in
specific, designated classified study areas. You may not take classified
material to your room or off base.

Syllabus Flow
A course map and management flowchart are in the F-15E syllabus
available to review in your flying squadron or the lounge in the academic

building. The course map (Figure D-1) shows the relative order in which
the instruction is presented and how the various media fit together.

The course map shows the general order in which courses will be taught,
but more importantly, it shows what the prerequisites are to a specific
event. It is your responsibility to make sure you have completed all
prerequisites prior to any syllabus event. If you are scheduled for an
event and have not completed the prerequisites, tell the scheduler or your
flight commander.

This creates the need for the weekly/daily schedule published by your
squadron, which is the final word on the coming day’s events.
Additionally, the daily schedule published by academics gives the location

of each class.

Aircraft General is highly compressed and will be completed in just over
one week. Lessons are listed below, and the date and time for each lesson
are found on the daily schedule. Specific lessons and the length of time

required will vary based on syllabus track.
