The cockpit pressure regulator automatically schedules pressurization and
activates when the canopy is closed and locked (engines running). The
regulator runs according to a schedule common among fighter aircraft and
appears in the flight manual (Figure D-8). Above 8000 feet MSL and
below approximately FL 240, the cockpit is pressurized at 8000 feet.

Windshield Anti-Ice Switch

This switch (Figure D-10) controls hot airflow from the primary heat
exchanger to the windshield exterior anti-ice air nozzle. The WNDSHLD
HOT caution is a function of windshield anti-ice air temperature and does
not measure the temperature of the windshield. Therefore, it is possible
to severely damage the windshield without any prior warning. Use this
switch only when necessary and then ensure it is turned off. One
technique is to guard the switch with your hand when it is on.

CAUTION

Use of the anti-ice system under non-icing conditions
may damage the windshield.

Engine Anti-Ice/Heat System

The engine anti-ice/heat system consists of an ice detector in the left inlet
duct and the engine anti-ice/heat system. The ice detector is always on. It
activates the inlet ice caution on the MPD/MPCD when an icing condition
exists in the left inlet duct. The engine anti-ice/heat system uses 13th
stage bleed air to prevent icing on the front of the engine. Bleed air
passes through a DEEC/engine anti-ice/heat switch controlled shutoff
valve and into the engine inlet case. The engine anti-ice/heat switch is
located on the ECS control panel and has three positions (Figure D-11).

ON Activates the engine anti-ice/heat system

OFF Deactivates the engine anti-ice/heat system

TEST Checks the ice detector operation, and turns on the inlet
ice caution, as well as the MASTER CAUTION and yellow
ENGINE CAUTION lights (both cockpits)

The DEEC automatically shuts off the engine anti-ice/heat when any of
the following conditions exist.

e Altitude is above 30,000 feet
e Engine inlet temperature is above 60°F
e Throttle is beyond mid range

e Bleed air gets too hot (above 750°F)

ACG-5 D-12


Text from ACG-5_Environmental_Control_System_Canopy__Steps_page_19.jpeg:
Since this is an anti-ice and not a de-ice system, it is essential that

PITOT STATIC SYSTEM

The pitot static system uses multiple pitot and static sources for
redundancy and to provide each engine inlet controller with conditions
particular to that inlet during flight. There is an airstream pitot static
mast on each side of the forward fuselage, and a pitot mast and flush
static port on each inlet duct (Figure D-13). Together they provide total
and static air pressure to the standby instruments, air data computer
(ADC), pitch/roll channel assembly, flap airspeed switch, dynamic
pressure sensor assembly and the inlet controllers.

The MSOGS, located behind door 6R, consists of an oxygen concentrator,
regulator (Figure D-17) and an integral, self-charging backup oxygen
system (BOS).

OXY BIT

ACG-05-17

Figure D - 17. MSOGS Regulator.

After TCTO 1F-15E-561C or TCTO 1F-15E-725 (latest modification),
preconditioned bleed air from the water extractor portion of the air
conditioning system is the only source of air to the MSOGS.

NOTE

Because MSOGS uses ECS air, if ECS is turned off (cabin temp switch
or air source knob OFF), MSOGS capability (except for breathing gas

remaining in the BOS) will be lost. MSOGS will also be lost if only the
emergency generator is operating in isolate.

To ensure the proper amount of inlet air is available for power-up BIT and
to eliminate false concentrator BIT latches, MSOGS should be run only
after the second engine has been started.

The system provides air that has been filtered to remove nitrogen and
provides oxygen enriched breathing gas to the aircrew. All contaminants
may not be filtered out. It is possible to get fumes from other aircraft
system failures (such as hydraulic fumes) through the ECS. The
concentrator automatically selects the backup oxygen supply (BOS) during
a system failure. The MSOGS monitor/controller continuously samples
the breathing gas to ensure the oxygen concentration of the output gas is
above acceptable levels. The aircraft essential bus supplies electrical
power for MSOGS.

D-21 ACG-5


Text from ACG-5_Environmental_Control_System_Canopy__Steps_page_28.jpeg:
The regulator of the MSOGS looks very similar to the LOX regulator. The
PBG (pressure breathing) option on the supply lever is fully discussed in
the COMBAT EDGE system explanation in the next section of the
workbook. The system is electrically driven. During engine start and
shut down, the FCP supply lever should be off. Move the lever to ON after
both generators are operating. In this case, the aircrew may have to start
with the oxygen masks off because the system will not supply air to
breathe until the system is electrically powered.

CAUTION

Do not lift the regulator toggle switch
when switching between OFF and ON.
Damage to the regulator switch will result.

The BOS provides a total of 16 minutes of oxygen enriched breathing gas
(8 minutes per crew member). BOS normal pressure is 20-450 psi. If BOS
pressure drops below 20 psi, breathing may be restricted. If pressure goes
below 16 psi, the BOS activates to build back normal pressure. If the
bleed air pressure is low (e.g., single engine/single bleed source idle
descent), the system may switch to the BOS. Normal mode will be
selected again when the bleed air pressure is restored (throttle advanced
to 73-74%). BOS is automatically recharged when MSOGS is producing
93% oxygen enriched gas and adequate pressure is available to the
concentrator. A minimum of 28 psi on the oxygen gauge is required to
charge the BOS.

BOS cannot be manually selected. It can be tested and selected via the
OXY BIT button. The system performs a power up BIT on start. The
OXY BIT light illuminates with a successful BIT. Reset by pressing and
releasing the OXY BIT button/light two times in the front cockpit only.
(The first push acknowledges the BIT and checks the BOS. The second
push exits the BOS.) If the power up BIT fails, the OXYGEN caution and
MASTER CAUTION lights come on. The system also performs a
continuous BIT. If the system fails the continuous BIT, the oxygen
caution light and master caution light illuminate. The system then
switches to BOS. Ifthe situation is corrected, the cautions are removed
and the system reverts from BOS back to the normal system. You can
also perform a power up BIT by turning off the front cockpit regulator for
more than 1 second and then back to on.

ACG-5 D - 22


Text from ACG-5_Environmental_Control_System_Canopy__Steps_page_29.jpeg:
You can check the BOS by using the OXY BIT button. Pressing and
releasing the OXY BIT button switches the system to BOS and allows the
aircrew to read the BOS pressure on the gauge. You should get a BOS
pressure reading less than 450 psi, MASTER CAUTION light and
OXYGEN caution. Pushing the OXY BIT light a second time extinguishes
these lights and puts the system back to normal. As you breathe, the
pressure returns to the normal MSOGS pressure range of 10-60 psi.

COMBAT EDGE System

Combined Advanced Technology Enhanced Design “G” Ensemble
(COMBAT EDGE) equipment is an acronym for an innovation in
technology that gives the fighter aircrew a combat edge in the air-to-air
arena.

The COMBAT EDGE system operates in normal flight and pressure
breathing for G (PBG) modes. The equipment enhances aircrew tolerance
to G forces. The supply/mode control lever (located on the aircraft
regulator panel), controls selection between normal flight oxygen supply
and PBG (Figure D-18). The proper mix of cockpit air and oxygen at the
correct pressure is supplied to the mask as a function of altitude. This
function is called pressure breathing for altitude (PBA).

Pressure Breathing for G (PBG) Operation

COMBAT EDGE provides the tactical aircrew member with a PBG system
for positive acceleration protection at altitudes up to 50,000 feet. The
COMBAT EDGE equipment is used in conjunction with the G-suit
currently used in the Air Force. The aircraft anti-G valve senses the onset
of positive G conditions and provides pressurized engine bleed air at a
predetermined schedule to the G-suit and the oxygen regulator pressure
sensor. Regulated air and oxygen, at a predetermined schedule, are
supplied to the COMBAT EDGE equipment to provide vest inflation and
positive pressure breathing gas for breathing. The system provides PBG
at acceleration loads between +4G and +9G. This is accomplished by
equipping the oxygen regulator with a device to sense a pressure signal
from the high flow anti-G valve. At G loads above +4G, the input signal to
the oxygen regulator commands PBG to the vest, mask and helmet
bladder. If pressure breathing for both G and altitude are required, the
regulator provides the higher of the two pressure schedules. The
COMBAT EDGE equipment, used with the anti-G garment enhances the
M1/L1 aircrew straining maneuvers. M1/L1 aircrew straining maneuvers
are still required to be performed.

COMBAT EDGE Equipment

CSU-17/P Vest Assembly

There is a vest to be worn, similar in design to the G-Suit (pneumatic
bladder contained in a Nomex garment, with front zippered closure for
easy donning and doffing). The vest is worn on the upper torso of the
crewmember, over the standard flight suit, providing chest
counterpressure during PBG. A hole within the left-hand side zipper
enclosure provides for possible future use of a torso cooling system.

ACG-5 D - 24


Text from ACG-5_Environmental_Control_System_Canopy__Steps_page_31.jpeg:
CRU-94/P Integrated Terminal Block (ITB)

The ITB serves as the central interface for breathing gas hoses, the vest
hose and the emergency oxygen hose. It also contains a pressure relief
valve that provides system overpressure protection for the aircrew
member when the vest is not being worn or has been inadvertently
disconnected. This prevents the operator from receiving excessive PBG
when not wearing the vest, even if the regulator switch is inadvertently
left in the PBG position. The ITB provides a man/aircraft interface
separation point during ground egress or ejection and is categorized as
manside equipment, although it is stowed in the aircraft. The ITB also
contains a split ring quick disconnect with a disconnect warning device,
which warns that the crewmember is disconnected from the oxygen
source. The CRU-94/P has an upper connector that goes to the oxygen
mask and a lower connector that goes to the vest. Expensive damage can
result if the crewmember attempts to connect his oxygen hose to the
wrong port.

KMU-511/P Helmet Modification Kit

The helmet used for COMBAT EDGE is the HGU-55/P with a modification
providing for automatic mask tensioning required for PBG. This
modification consists of an air bladder installed with hook and pile (velcro)
fasteners, between the thermoplastic liner (TPL) and the foam liner in the
rear, lower part of the helmet. A bladder supply hose passes through the
helmet shell and connects to the female side of a quick disconnect. This
connector allows separation of the helmet and mask for maintenance and
parachute descent procedures. The visors furnished with the helmet
modification kits are similar to the current visor, except that the lower
edge is reshaped to fit neatly against the PBG oxygen mask.

MBU-20/P Oxygen Mask Assembly

The oxygen mask is required for PBG. The oxygen mask contains
separate inhalation and exhalation valves. The separate valves require
the oxygen delivery hose to be offset from the center of the mask. The
inhalation and exhalation valves are interconnected by a compensation
tube. The compensation tube senses inhalation pressure and a portion is
directed to the underside of the exhalation valve plate. This compensating
pressure keeps the exhalation valve shut during inhalation and allows
PBA up to 50,000 feet.

CANOPY SYSTEM
Components

The canopy system consists of a large clamshell canopy (Figure D-19), a
hydraulic actuator mounted at the aft of the cockpit, a hydraulic
accumulator that allows operation prior to starting engines, and a
pyrotechnic system for emergency canopy jettison.

ACG-05-18

Figure D - 19.

Utility A powers the actuator that raises and lowers the canopy. This
actuator contains an accumulator that gives approximately three cycles of
the canopy without hydraulic power. A hand pump socket connector
exists in the nose wheelwell to operate the canopy without utility A
hydraulic pressure and with canopy accumulator hydraulic pressure
depleted. The socket connector is pumped using a 42” drive ratchet.

To operate the canopy without accumulator pressure, move the external
canopy control handle or one of the two internal handles to the UP or
DOWN position, and then operate the hand pump in the nose wheelwell.
To open the canopy from inside the cockpit with accumulator hydraulic
pressure depleted, place the handle in the UP position and then push up
on the canopy. A nitrogen charge (approximately 400 psi) in the canopy
actuator aids in opening the canopy manually.

ACG-5 D - 28


Text from ACG-5_Environmental_Control_System_Canopy__Steps_page_35.jpeg:
Controls

Internal Canopy Control Handle

The front and rear canopy control handles (Figure D-20) interconnect and
move in unison. Each has four positions:

UP

HOLD

Raises the canopy to maximum open. If selected from
LOCKED, the canopy unlocks, moves aft and then
rises.

Provides a hydraulic lock at any point in the cycle.
Should be used if canopy is to be left open. A leaky
accumulator may allow the canopy to creep.

Lowers the canopy full down and then forward against
the windscreen.

Mechanically locks the canopy. Causes a hydraulic
block, so the canopy must be against the windscreen
before it can be mechanically locked.

ACG-05-19

Figure D - 20. Internal Control Handles.

D - 29 ACG-5


Text from ACG-5_Environmental_Control_System_Canopy__Steps_page_36.jpeg:
When lowered, the canopy may bounce slightly as it reaches the sill. Once
the canopy contacts the windscreen, wait 10 seconds before locking it.
Latches on the frame engage fittings on the cockpit sill to secure the
canopy. When locked, the canopy seal inflates around the perimeter of the
canopy frame for cockpit pressurization. Ensure that the CAN UNLKD
light is on with handle in DN, and that the light is out when the handle is
moved full forward to LOCKED.

External Canopy Control Handle

There is a flush-mounted external control handle (Figure D-21) on the left
fuselage, below the canopy, which duplicates the internal control handle
functions. To access the handle, push the release button. To stow, push it
in until the retaining latch engages.

Emergency Canopy System

Internal canopy jettison handles (Figure D-22) are located in each cockpit
under the left sill just aft of the instrument panels. The external jettison
handle is located just below and forward of the external canopy control
handle. The system incorporates a pyrotechnic canopy remover that is
independent of the normal system. It will safely jettison the canopy only
from the closed and locked position.

For internal jettison, depress the unlock button and rotate the handle aft.

Once fired, the handle locks in place and it (plus the initiator) must be
replaced. To use the external jettison handle, depress the release button
to open the access door and pull out the handle and its 8-foot lanyard.
Pulling the handle initiates canopy jettison.

Improperly placed or unsecured items near the canopy remover may
actuate the canopy jettison bellcrank causing loss of canopy.

Do not place personal items, such as helmet and mask, on the windscreen
because the canopy and windscreen are easily scratched. Do not use the
canopy as a note pad.

BOARDING STEPS

From ground level, pressing the flush-mounted release button below and

Stow the steps by pushing up on the bottom step until it locks (step
release button will be flush). A boarding steps position indicator is located
on the bulkhead above and aft of the g-suit connection in the front cockpit.

If the steps lower in flight, some buffeting may occur at high speed. Check
the position indicator or have a wingman confirm steps position. The
steps have extended in high speed flight with no adverse effect. However,
reduce speed as soon as practical since structural failure of the steps will
probably FOD the left engine.

MALFUNCTIONS, WARNINGS & CAUTIONS
ECS Malfunction

MASTER CAUTION, ENGINE Caution and ECS Caution On MPD/MPCD

An ECS caution (Figure D-24) warns of avionics overtemperature (above
140°F) or low cooling airflow.

Make sure the temperature control switch is in AUTO and the air source
knob is in BOTH.

On the ground one engine may not provide adequate cooling airflow for
the avionics. If and when this happens, an immediate automatic avionics
shutdown occurs. The only indication of this condition will be blank
displays. Increasing the operating engine to 73% rpm should allow
normal avionics operation within 2 minutes. If normal operation does not
resume, it may be necessary to start the second engine.

ACG-5 D - 36


Text from ACG-5_Environmental_Control_System_Canopy__Steps_page_43.jpeg:
If both engines are running and the ECS caution remains on after

1 minute, the system may not be getting bleed air from both engines. Try
to isolate the bleed source by rotating the air source knob through all
positions while the ground crew checks exhaust ports. Once the operating
source of the ECS air is determined, advance the throttle of the operating
bleed air source to 77% and turn off all nonessential avionics. Cycle the
throttle of the nonoperating bleed air source from idle to 78% rpm and
cycle the air source knob through all positions.

If the ECS caution light remains on after 10 minutes, shut down either
engine. This should automatically shut down much of the avionics
equipment including the HUD and the MPDP. If automatic shutdown
does not occur, shut off all avionics equipment except the UHF to protect
the equipment. Avionics that cannot be turned off will continue to be heat
damaged.

In flight, maintain moderate airspeeds and rpm if the ECS caution is on
because very low or high engine rpm can degrade ECS operation. Shut
down high cooling demand systems first, such as the radar, ICS, TEWS
and selected MPD/MPCDs. Nonessential avionics should be turned off for
their own protection. If diversion of all avionics cooling airflow via the
EMERG VENT handle is unsuccessful, turn the cabin temperature control
switch to OFF. This switches avionics cooling to ram air, but temperature
will continue to be system monitored. Optimum ram air cooling is
obtained at 400 knots and 15,000 feet. When landing single engine,
automatic avionics shut down will occur at touchdown or on roll out. If it
does, the HUD and cockpit displays go blank, and UHF 1 is inoperative. If
you land with both engines operating and an ECS caution, consider
shutting down an engine to get the automatic avionics shut down.

NOTE

ECS turbine bearing disintegration can be related to an ECS light
and/or smoke and fumes. The malfunction usually causes a high

pitched whine that rises as rpm increases, and can result in floor
vibration. The ECS turbine is shut down by placing the cabin
temperature control switch or the air source knob to OFF.

Text from ACG-5_Environmental_Control_System_Canopy__Steps_page_44.jpeg:
Display Flow Low Caution

A DISPLAY FLOW LOW caution (Figure D-25) during dual engine ground
operation indicates low cooling air flow to the cockpit displays. Turning
off all nonessential displays helps protect them from heat damage. The
mission must be aborted and the condition corrected.

During single engine operation, increasing the rpm above idle will
extinguish the light if the ECS is operating normally. If it does not, abort
the mission.

A DISPLAY FLOW LOW while airborne requires turning the ICS OFF to
increase the cooling air supply to the cockpit displays. Nonessential
displays should be turned off for their own protection. The remote map
reader (RMR) and MPCDs should be turned off as soon as possible since
they are the most sensitive to heat and they have no overheat protection.
Turning the emergency vent handle increases display cooling airflow, but
dumps cabin pressure; therefore altitude should be below 25,000 MSL
before turning the emergency vent handle.

Bleed Air Malfunction

MASTER CAUTION, ENGINE Caution and R BLEED AIR/L BLEED AIR
Caution On MPD/MPCD

This caution (Figure D-26) displays when a bleed air leak occurs in an
engine bay or air flowing from a primary heat exchanger becomes too hot.
This creates the potential for a serious fire or excessive ECS temperature
and can cause confusion and misinterpretation. Prompt action is
required. With a left engine bleed air leak, selecting right engine air
source closes the left bleed air valve. If the caution remains on, pull the
left throttle to idle to reduce bleed air flow from that engine. If both
cautions appear, turn the air source knob off.

Text from ACG-5_Environmental_Control_System_Canopy__Steps_page_50.jpeg:
Cockpit Pressurization/Extreme Temperature Malfunctions

Cockpit Pressurization Malfunctions on the Ground

Aircrews should check to ensure the cockpit is not overpressurized (cockpit
pressure altitude is lower than actual field elevation). If this occurs, the
pilot should turn the emergency vent handle to dump cabin pressure.
Otherwise, the canopy may separate from the aircraft if opened before
cockpit pressure is dumped.

Loss of Cabin Pressure

If loss of cabin pressure occurs, select 100% oxygen, descend to the lowest
practical altitude (25,000 feet maximum), check the emergency vent
handle in and vertical, and land as soon as practical. This situation may
be reportable as a physiological incident and the aircrew may need to see
a flight surgeon.

Extreme Cockpit Temperature

If this should occur, attempt to control the temperature in manual. If you
cannot control the temperature in auto or manual and it becomes
excessive, you should turn and pull the emergency vent handle below
18,000 feet. If the temperature is excessively cold, consider a descent to
warmer air. If the temperature is excessively hot, consider a climb to
cooler air and/or decelerate to a slower speed. (Optimum ram air cooling
is obtained at 400 knots and 15,000 feet).

Canopy Warnings/Cautions

CANOPY UNLOCKED Warning Light

This light (Figure D-31) illuminates whenever the canopy is unlocked or
when the canopy actuated initiator lanyard (“pigtail”) is disconnected.
The pigtail is located on the left side of the aft cockpit rear bulkhead.

For a ground malfunction, relock the canopy (cycle the control handle to
DN and then back to locked). If not remedied, the “pigtail” might be
disconnected. Give the jet back to maintenance.

The recommended corrective procedure for an in-flight canopy malfunction
is to slow below 250 knots. Dump cabin pressure (below FL 250) by
turning the emergency vent handle. Make sure the canopy control handle
is full forward.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL SYSTEM (ECS)

ECS Description

The ECS provides conditioned air and pressurization for the cockpit,
avionics, windshield anti-fog, anti-ice, anti-G, canopy seal and the fuel
system. The system uses extracted air, or bleed air, from both engines for
normal operations. The source of the bleed air is the thirteenth stage of
the engine compressor. This high pressure air is extremely hot, but
through a series of components, conditioned air is delivered to the various
systems. Either engine can provide enough air to operate the ECS, and
ram air cooling is also available should normal ECS fail. Should ECS
cooling air fail and the air source knob or cockpit temperature switch be
placed to OFF, ram air is automatically provided to the avionics for
cooling.

Text from ACG-5_Environmental_Control_System_Canopy__Steps_page_8.jpeg:
The primary heat exchanger initially cools the bleed air, decreasing the
air temperature from the 1000°F to the 200°F range. The compressor
compresses the air and then the secondary heat exchanger cools it again.
A high pressure water separator (HPWS) removes the water by using a
cyclone effect to extract moisture. This dry air is put through a cooling
turbine where rapid expansion drops the temperature further. The
conditioned air is now ready for use. A few systems deviate from this
track. Fuel pressurization (which has its own additional heat exchanger)
and windshield anti-ice and canopy seal (which use hot air), all branch off
after the primary heat exchanger and before the compressor.
The ECS system provides cool air to the following:

¢ Cockpit air vents

e Windshield anti-fog

e Multipurpose display/multipurpose color displays

e Upfront controls

e Forward avionics bays (left and right)

e Internal countermeasures set

e Radar waveguides (throughout the aircraft)
