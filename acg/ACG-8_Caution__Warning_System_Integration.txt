AIR COMBAT COMMAND


Text from ACG-8_Caution__Warning_System_Integration_page_10.jpeg:
“MESSAGE” and “THREAT WARNING’ are joint tactical information
distribution system (JTIDS) voice messages. They are only heard during
COMM BIT until JTIDS is installed in the aircraft.

Voice warning volume cannot be adjusted.

Once the voice warning is stated it is not given again unless the condition
causing the voice warning system to activate is corrected and the
condition recurs.

Voice warnings for “OBSTACLE AHEAD” or “TF FAIL” are repeated until
the condition causing them is corrected.

Certain failures of the overload warning system (OWS) would result in a
continuous “OVER-G” warning. If “OVER-G” comes on for 30 seconds and
then stops, it may not be because the system has corrected itself. Logic is
incorporated to shut down the overload warning system after 30 seconds
of accumulated voice warning. Check the HUD current G and maximum
allowable G to verify proper OWS operation.

The “PULL-UP, PULL-UP” voice warning associated with the ground

collision warning system (GCWS) is given a maximum of four times and
has precedence over all other voice warnings.

Text from ACG-8_Caution__Warning_System_Integration_page_11.jpeg:
The VW/TONE SILENCE button is located on the RICP and ICSCP
(Figure D-3) and can be used to silence any current voice or tone warning
for up to one minute. Only the current voice warning can be silenced.
New voice warnings are always heard.

Combined Voice Warnings and Warning Lights
In conjunction with voice warnings, red warning lights are available for:

AB BURN-THROUGH LEFT/RIGHT
LOW ALTITUDE

OBSTACLE AHEAD

TF FAIL

WARNING - AMAD FIRE

WARNING - ENGINE FIRE LEFT/RIGHT

The voice warning system for the AMAD fire detection and FTIT overtemp
indicators first become operational with application of external power or
JFS operation.

Voice warnings for engine fire detection and fuel low level become
operational with the application of external power, and/or when the
emergency generator comes on-line during the first engine start.

NOTE: Each voice warning cause and corrective action is covered in the

associated system lesson and in the subsequent lesson on Emergency
Procedures/Abnormal Operations (ACG-9).

Warning Tones
Warning tones are available for:

Angle of attack (gear down)
Overload warning system (OWS)
High angle of attack (gear up)
Departure (yaw rate)

Unsafe landing gear

Automatic terrain following

Five of the warning tones use audible frequencies from 250 to 1600 Hz.
Chart D-1 shows how these tones relate to each other and are used to
warn the aircrew.

Text from ACG-8_Caution__Warning_System_Integration_page_16.jpeg:
AOA Warning Tone (with Landing Gear Down)

The AOA warning tone only sounds when the landing gear is down. At
approximately 30 units AOA a beeping tone sounds. The beep rate
increases as the AOA increases. You should eliminate the tone by
reducing the AOA.

OWS Warning Tone

An overload warning tone beeps (single rate) at 85% maximum allowable
G or 1 G below the maximum allowable, whichever is lower. G readout on
the HUD flashes in conjunction with the tone onset to warn that
maximum allowable G is being approached. The beep rate increases as
the percentage of maximum allowable G increases. At 92%, the tone rate
doubles. At 100% the tone becomes steady. The voice warning (“OVER-G,
OVER-G”) replaces the OWS tone above 100%. The warning continues
until the overload condition is corrected, or stops after 30 seconds.

High AOA Warning Tone (with Landing Gear Up)

The programmable high AOA warning tone cues the aircrew when the
programmed AOA is exceeded. The system defaults to 30 units AOA at
aircraft power up with CFTs and A/G stores loaded, but can be
programmed for 20-45 units AOA (entering a value between 46-50 units
turns the tone OFF). The warning tone is heard and the AOA on the
HUD flashes when the limit is reached or exceeded. The warning tone is
characterized by a series of audio “doublets” and remains on until AOA is
reduced to below the programmed AOA.

Departure Warning Tone

The departure (yaw rate) tone sounds only with the gear up. A beeping
tone sounds when actual or predicted yaw rate reaches 15°/second. As the
yaw rate increases, the beep rate increases and reaches its maximum at
60°/second yaw rate. In addition, a voice warning “YAW RATE, YAW
RATE? is also heard.

ACG-8 D-10


Text from ACG-8_Caution__Warning_System_Integration_page_17.jpeg:
The “YAW RATE” warning tone may be checked by pressing the takeoff
trim button. When the takeoff trim light is on and the takeoff trim button
is depressed, the “YAW RATE” voice warning sounds and the yaw rate
warning tone beeps until the takeoff trim button is released.

The 900 Hz tone is obviously used for three distinct conditions. In certain
flight conditions, parameters may exist to initiate one or more of these
tones. The CC priority is: (1) departure warning (yaw rate), (2) overload
warning (OVER-G), and (3) high AOA. In addition, a high AOA tone may
be heard in conjunction with “OVER-G” voice warning. A departure tone
will inhibit the high AOA for three seconds, and always has priority.

The relation of the three 900 Hz tones is presented graphically in
Figure D-4.

Landing Gear Warning Tone

The landing gear warning tone sounds under the following conditions:

e Ten seconds after the landing gear handle is placed in the down
position. The tone continues until all gear is down and locked.

e When the following conditions exist simultaneously:

aircraft is below 10,000 feet MSL,

airspeed is less than 200 knots,

rate of descent is greater than 250 feet per minute,
gear handle is not down.

@ When the air data computer (ADC) fails. The tone sounds regardless
of the altitude, airspeed, or rate of descent. The warning tone may be
silenced by pressing the button next to the gear handle (Figure D-5).

ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION

This student workbook is designed to provide information on the F-15E,
its systems, and capabilities. It is not a sole source document, but is to be
used in conjunction with other standard Air Force publications and
technical manuals. If you find any differences between the material
contained herein and other governing regulations, adhere to the
regulations and notify the OPDR.

Changes to this workbook are indicated with a heavy black line in the left
margin.

NOTE

The VW/TONE silence button stops any current AOA, yaw and OWS tone
for up to 1 minute. To silence the landing gear warning tone, use the
landing gear warning tone silence button.

LANTIRN Bell

The LANTIRN system produces a “BINK-BINK’” tone to advise the
aircrew that automatic terrain following (ATF) has been selected but is
not controlling the aircraft (no ATF condition) or that the terrain following
system is unarmed (no AUTO FLYUP protection provided).

In some cases, the bell tone may not be heard simultaneously with
illumination of the UNARMED/NO ATF light, since the TF related voice
warnings have priority over the bell tone. The bell tone sounds after the
other voice warnings with a higher priority have sounded.

CAUTION INDICATIONS

Cautions provide indications of system malfunctions which require less
than immediate attention.

There are two ways that cautions are usually displayed:

e Amber lights on the CAUTION LIGHTS panels in the front and rear
cockpits.

e Onthe MPD/MPCDs in both cockpits.
Though there are technically no voice messages defined as cautions (they

are all voice warnings), some voice warnings may be received with display
cautions; e.g., BINGO FUEL and XFER PUMP.

MASTER CAUTION Light

MASTER CAUTION lights on both cockpit instrument panels

(Figures D-6 and D-7) are used to direct your attention to displayed
cautions. The MASTER CAUTIONS light up at the same time as the
following: EMER BST ON, BST SYS MAL, NUCLEAR, FUEL LOW, L/R
GEN, ENGINE, FLT CONTR, HYD, DSPL FLO LO, OXYGEN, or when
any MPD/MPCD (display) caution comes on.

The MASTER CAUTION lights do not light up with the red warning
lights. However, conditions/malfunctions that generate cautions as a
result of the warning condition will illuminate the MASTER CAUTION.

MPD/MPCD display cautions do not go out until the condition/malfunction
is corrected.

An exception to the display caution logic is the autopilot caution system.
The FLT CONTR light and AUTO PLT display caution are extinguished
by pressing the MASTER CAUTION light. Subsequent autopilot related
problems alert the aircrew using the same system and display cautions.

The RCP MSTR CAUT light does not turn off the master caution lights or
reset the master caution light circuit.

Master cautions do not light with the AV BIT caution. Still, pressing
either master caution does turn off the AV BIT caution light.

Normal Operation

The MPD/MPCD cautions are initially displayed on the FCP right MPD
and the RCP right MPCD (Figure D-10). (Cautions go to the designated
MPD/MPCD, even if it is off or inoperative.) The cautions are displayed in
three columns and written from left to right. The most recent caution is
displayed furthest right on the highest row. When displayed, they
normally occlude the information behind them. MPD/MPCD display
cautions are removed when conditions are corrected, or the cautions are

Caution Declutter

As long as at least one display caution is available for viewing, the crew
may declutter all cautions from the display. This is done in the FCP by
holding the MASTER CAUTION depressed while pressing down (in) on
the castle switch on the FCP stick. In the RCP, holding the MSTR CAUT

light depressed while thumbing aft on either coolie switch will provide the
same function.

All currently displayed cautions are removed and a boxed CAUT is
displayed in the lower left corner of the MPD/MPCD of each cockpit

(Figure D-11). The boxed CAUT only occludes the area behind it and not
the whole line.

Cautions decluttered mode is exited and all current cautions are
redisplayed when:

The IFF MODE 4 display caution can be caused by failure to respond to a
valid interrogation, zeroized code, or internal component failure. The IFF
MODE 4 caution is removed from the MPD/MPCD by pressing PB #16
(M/4 CAUT DSBL) on the BIT 2 display (Figure D-12). This removes the
caution if it is displayed on the cautions display or if the cautions are
decluttered from the caution display.

If the MODE 4 caution disable is deselected with display cautions
decluttered (CAUT boxed), a MODE 4 caution causes the cautions
decluttered mode to be exited. The IFF MODE 4 caution is displayed
along with other current cautions.

Moving Cautions

If desired, the right MPD/MPCD caution display may be moved to another
display. Cautions then appear on the newly designated MPD/MPCD. If
the causes for the cautions are cleared, any new cautions again appear on
the last display selected for display of cautions.

It may be necessary to move the MPD/MPCD caution display for purposes
of regaining information that is being occluded, or to monitor cautions
when the designated MPD/MPCD is inoperative or turned off.

In the FCP, cautions are moved by holding the MASTER CAUTION light
depressed while:

e moving the castle switch left to move the cautions to the left MPD.
e moving the castle switch aft to move the cautions to the MPCD.

In the RCP, the MSTR CAUT light and hand controllers are used to move
the cautions.

TEXT
INTRODUCTION

The F-15E Warning, Caution, and Advisory system alerts the aircrew to
system degrades, failures, malfunctions, and routine operation by the use
of the following.

Warning Indications - Lights, voice, and tones that warn of a system
malfunction and/or other important information.

Caution Indications - Lights, MPD/MPCD display, and tones indicating
system malfunction and/or information to be noted.

Advisory Lights - Provide signs of safe and normal conditions and
impart information for routine purposes.

WARNING INDICATIONS
Warning Lights

All warning lights are red and provide indications of system malfunctions
that require immediate aircrew attention. They are located at or near the
top of the instrument panel in both cockpits (Figures D-1 and D-2).
Exceptions are the gear handle light (FCP) and the gear unsafe light
(RCP). The AMAD fire and AB burn-through lights are located in the
FCP only. When the condition that caused the warning light to come on is
corrected, the light goes off.

NOTE: Each warning light display, its cause, and corrective action are
covered in the associated system lesson and in the following lesson,
Emergency Procedures/Abnormal Operations (ACG-9).

For quick reference of warning light causes and initial corrective action,
use the Warnings, Cautions, and Advisories matrix found in TO 1F-15E-1,
Section III, and the Emergency Procedures Section of the F-15E aircrew
checklist.

Voice Warnings
Voice warnings are available for the following and are stated as:

“AB BURN-THROUGH LEFT”

“AB BURN-THROUGH RIGHT”
“BINGO FUEL”

“LOW ALTITUDE”

“OBSTACLE AHEAD”

“OVER-G”

“TF FAIL”

“WARNING, AMAD FIRE”
“WARNING, OVERTEMP LEFT”
“WARNING, OVERTEMP RIGHT”
“WARNING, FUEL LOW”
“WARNING, ENGINE FIRE LEFT”
“WARNING, ENGINE FIRE RIGHT”
“WARNING, TRANSFER PUMP”
“YAW RATE”

“MESSAGE”

“THREAT WARNING”

“PULL-UP, PULL-UP”

With the exception of “OVER-G,” “OBSTACLE AHEAD,” “PULL-UP,” and
“TF FAIL” warnings, all voice warnings are stated twice. For example, a
left engine fire causes the voice warning system to state:

e “WARNING - ENGINE FIRE LEFT; WARNING - ENGINE FIRE
LEFT”

or an AMAD fire causes the voice warning to state:

e “WARNING - AMAD FIRE; WARNING - AMAD FIRE”
