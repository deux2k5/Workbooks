Loading an A/G Store

To correlate information, here are the steps to program an A/G stores
load. Assume there are two MK-84s onboard, one each on stations 2 & 8,
and 12 CBU-58s, six on each CFT. When the aircrew brings up the A/G
LOAD format (Figure D-2), the number is visible, but not the type of
stores on stations 2, 8, LC and RC. Also visible is that a centerline fuel
tank is loaded (fuel tanks self-identify).

If the MC/DTM data was loaded before bringing up the display, the
display would have initialized with the MC/DTM programmed legends. In
this case, all the munitions previously loaded on the aircraft were dropped
during the last mission, therefore the legends come up blank. When
munitions are physically loaded on the aircraft, the PACS is able to sense
the correct quantity of munitions, but not the correct type. For ballistics
and OWS purposes, the PACS must be programmed with the air-to-
ground munitions that are actually aboard the aircraft. This can be
accomplished via a MC/DTM, or via the display itself. The MK-84s are in
Group 4. Push the button beside MK-84 and a box appears around the
legend. This shows that it is selected to load. Next, push PBs #16 and
#20; a boxed MK84 appears below the buttons showing what is loaded on
the stations. That is all there is to identifying dumb bombs to the PACS.

Loading a CBU/MK-20

Page 3 of the PACS weapons load menu lists all dispenser munitions
certified for carriage on the F-15E (Figure D-3). To identify the stores
actually loaded on a station, select (box) the store by pressing the push
button next to the appropriate store legend and then press the appropriate
station push buttons. In this example (Figure D-3), box CBU58 by
pressing PB #13; then press PBs #17 and #19 to locate CBU58 on stations
RC and LC. When a dispenser munition is selected and located on a
station it initializes with the default fuze and settings (or AFMSS selected
fuze and settings). At this point, the FUZE LOAD option appears at PB
#7.

Pressing PB #7 brings up the FUZE LOAD page (Figure D-4). Fuzes
compatible with the weapon are listed in the lower center of the display
with the current selection boxed. Pressing PB #4 steps through the fuze
choices. Selectable fuze settings are displayed between PBs #2 and #3
and/or between PBs #14 and #13. PBs #2, #8, #13 and #14 are used to
increment or decrement setting values. Additionally, burst height and
time can be entered by typing a valid entry into the UFC scratchpad and
pressing the appropriate pushbutton (PB #2/3 or PB #13/14). After the
desired fuze and settings are selected, selecting ENTER at PB #10
completes the programming. In the example, the default fuze for the
CBUS8 is the FMU26 with a 2.0-second timer. To select the FMU56,
press PB #4 once. Since the FMU56 is a radar fuze, the altitude setting
appears between PBs #18 and #14. After setting the desired altitude, in
this case 250 feet, press PB #10 to enter the settings.

Tangential Conformal Fuel Tank (TCFT) Stores

When a CFT store is detected in the PACS, TCFT LOAD is displayed at
PB #9. After the weapon type has been identified and entered on the A/G
LOAD display, pressing PB #9 selects the TCFT LOAD display (Figure
D-6). The aircrew can now enter the exact CFT position of each store
loaded on this display. This enables the CC to accurately determine CFT
release sequence in order to apply the correct lateral ejection component,
and provide the proper azimuth steering to compensate for lateral
displacement of the weapon impact point(s) on the ground.

Stores entered on the TCFT LOAD display are also used for determination
of laser masking zones.

The station position legend(s) are boxed when selected and are accepted
when ENTER (PB #10) is depressed. The legend(s) is/are then unboxed
and the station positions are displayed under the corresponding CFT
weapon load (Figure D-6).

With the landing gear handle up, if the aircrew entered CFT position load
does not agree with the PACS supplied quantity, the PACS overrides the
aircrew entries in the following manner:

@ Ifthe aircrew entered too many CFT positions for the quantity
determined by the PACS, the PACS removes the aircrew entered
positions in the release order (IA, IF, OA, OF, OC and IC) until the
quantity matches the positions.

@ Ifthe aircrew entered too few (or no) CFT positions, the PACS fills out
the quantity with positions from the reverse release order.

Other Weapons Loading

Other weapons or stores like AGM-65s, GBUs, ECM pods, etc., are covered
in later, dedicated lessons. As mentioned previously, fuel tanks identify
themselves to the PACS so the aircrew does not have to load them except
in the training mode.

When loading a SUU-20, the aircrew must identify individual bombs
(BDU-33 or MK-106) for each of the six SUU-20 positions. After loading a
SUU-20 on the appropriate station, a bomblet submenu will appear as
shown in the middle part of Figure D-7. The A/G weapon load menu for
the SUU-20 displays the dispenser position numbers 1-6. To load a
SUU-20, first select the type of bombs (MK-106 or BDU-83), then select
the SUU-20 positions, then select enter. The type of bomb (BDU-33 or
MK-106) should be displayed next to the desired position under the
station where the SUU-20 is loaded. The aircraft PACS display tells the
operator the SUU-20 bomb positions (1-6) and type of bomb in the release
sequence. Note that the number of bombs remaining is not displayed;
only the SUU-20 bomb position next in the release sequence and type of
store loaded (Figure D-7).

The SUU-20M/N does not have mixed load capability like the SUU-20B/A.
With the SUU-20M loaded, the PACS initializes with 6 x MK-106s per
dispenser; with a SUU-20N loaded, the PACS initializes with 6 x BDU-33s
per dispenser. The display on the A/G status menu is identical for both
SUU-20M/N and SUU-20B/A. The only difference is bomb types
associated to the SUU-20 itself.

A/G WEAPON STATUS AND RELEASE PROGRAMMING

Once the munitions are loaded in the PACS, call up the A/G display to
program delivery functions and to monitor status. To do this, go back to
the menu and press PB #3, A/G. The resulting A/G display is shown in
Figure D-8.

Beside PB #5 is the delivery program option legend. A program consists of
the desired weapon delivery parameters and release options. The display
always initializes to the program option last displayed; depressing PB #5
cycles through the four program options. Program the delivery options by
first calling up the desired program number and then boxing the
appropriate munitions. In Figure D-9, the MK-84s on stations 2 and 8 are
assigned to PROG 1. The release options that the crew has are release
mode, release sequence, and drag/fuze arming. Whatever is in CC
memory will be what is initially displayed.

To change a release option, depress the button below it; this blanks out
the legend and brings up the choices for that option at the bottom of the
display. Figure D-9 shows this for the release mode options. Then by
pressing the button below the choice, CDIP or AUTO, enter it into PROG
1 and the display changes back, showing the new option, ready for more
programming.

ripple single: with the pickle button depressed, weapons
release continuously, one at a time, at the set interval until
the quantity selected on the quantity indicator has been
released. If more than one station is selected, the sequence
follows that in the STEP program.

ripple multiple: with the pickle button depressed, one weapon
is released from each selected station simultaneously and
continues at the selected interval until the selected quantity
has been released. If only one station is selected, the mode
works the same as ripple single.


Text from AGD-2_Air-to-Ground_Programmable_Armament_Control_System_page_21.jpeg:
When either RP SGL or RP MPL is selected, the quantity (QTY) and
interval (INTVL) are displayed (Figure D-10). To change the quantity of
bombs to be released, use alternate depressions of PB #8 for the unit's
digit and PB #4 for the ten's digit. Any number from 01 through 29 may
be used. The minimum release interval is weapon dependent (i.e., the CC
or PACS will ultimately determine the interval at which weapons are
released). If you program a weapon release interval less than the MRI,
the weapons will be dropped at the PACS or CC determined minimum
release interval. Refer to TO 1F-15E-34-1-1, A/G bombing, minimum
release interval. Now program the desired interval (feet between
impacts). Use PB #12 to change the ten's digit and PB #13 to change
hundreds. The stick length (first bomb to last bomb) for Figure D-10 is
150 feet.

The cross and along track corrections, loft angle and arming time are set
through the A/G delivery display on the MPD/MPCD. Note that each
PACS program has its own set of A/G delivery parameters. After exiting a
specific PACS program and entering another, the desired loft angle,
cross/along track corrections must be entered for the new program.

After completing a delivery program, the three remaining programs may
be used for the remaining munitions or to establish an alternate release
program for the ones just set up. When finished, stay in the A/G display
or exit to something else. There is no harm in leaving one or more
delivery programs blank.

As stated earlier, the PACS is smart and will keep the crew from making
many programming errors. For example, assume there are MK-84s on
station 2 and MK-20s on the left CFT. If the pilot tries to assign both of
them to the same program, as soon as the second munition is boxed, the
boxes will disappear. This should alert the pilot to the mismatch.

Some weapons can be wired to provide the option of selecting the type
profile after airborne, either low drag or high drag. In these cases, for
MK-82SE, MK-82-AR, and MK-84/AR the nose option selects both the
nose and center arming units and the low drag options. The tail or N/T
option selects either the tail or all three arming units, respectively, and
the high drag option. For the BLU-107, only the nose option is available;
this option selects both the nose and center arming units and the high
drag option.

The A/G PACS display with dispensers loaded and programmed is shown
on Figure D-11. In display A, CBU-52s are loaded and selected with the
MK-339-1 fuze options of PRIMARY and OPTION available at PBs #6 and
#7. In display C, CBU-87s are loaded and selected with the FZU-39 fuze
options of TIME and HEIGHT available at PBs #6 and #7. Choosing one
of the options at PB #6 or #7 selects the fuzing as programmed on the
FUZE LOAD display. Display B reflects the OPTION setting being
selected for the CBU-52s, and display D indicates the TIME function was
selected for the CBU-87s.

Bomb on Target (BOT)

For each delivery program (TRNG and CMBT) with a ripple delivery and
a quantity (QTY) greater than 1 selected, a BOT selection is available at
PB #15 (Figure D-12). The BOT initializes to the center of the string
(CTR). The first actuation of PB #15 advances the BOT to the first bomb
in the string. Each successive actuation increments the value by 1 until
the selected release QTY is reached. When the BOT number equals the
selected release QTY, the next actuation returns to CTR. If the selected
QTY is changed and increased, the BOT is not affected. If the new QTY is
decreased to less than the current BOT, the BOT defaults to CTR.

The BOT can also be entered through the UFC. If 0 is selected on the
scratchpad and PB #15 is pressed, CTR is selected. If a number between 1
and the selected QTY is entered in the scratchpad and PB #15 is pressed,
that number is displayed below the BOT at PB #15. If the selected QTY is
greater than the total number of bombs loaded on the selected stations,
that QTY number is displayed at PB #15, but all station and position on
target information is for the last bomb on the string. If a number greater
than the selected release QTY, or less than 0 is entered via the
scratchpad, the number in the scratchpad flashes and the BOT number at
PB #15 does not change.

With an even number of bombs in the string and CTR selected, the target

will be bracketed by the two middle bombs in the sequence. With an odd
number of bombs, the middle bomb will be on target.

Releasing a Weapon

The pilot or WSO will probably not fly around all the time with a PACS
format on one of the displays. So, when ready to drop bombs, bring up the
A/G PACS display (as a technique, many aircrew program an ARMT page
to the A/G master mode on one display). When it initializes, verify the
correct program number is showing. Insure that A/G master mode is
selected, then put the MASTER ARM switch to ARM. This satisfies all
the logic required by the PACS for delivery. A boxed RDY appears on the
display (Figure D-13) and the MASTER ARM light on the RCP caution
panel illuminates. The last step is to press the pickle button. Do not
quick pickle; both computed modes use the pickle button as a consent

switch. Immediate release will not occur in AUTO and may not occur in
CDIP.

NOTE

Although it is not absolutely necessary to have the A/G PACS display
called up, it is the only way to change intervals, weapons and delivery
options. Programs may be changed and the green “RDY” light status

verified on both the A/G PACS and the A/G Delivery Display.

Text from AGD-2_Air-to-Ground_Programmable_Armament_Control_System_page_28.jpeg:
As munitions are released, the stores aboard sensors keep track of the
quantity and update the display. However, these computations are not
instantaneous; it is possible for the OWS to register an over-G condition
while pulling off target based on stores you have already released. When
all weapons on a station are gone, the weapon legend is erased and
replaced by what is left, i.e., RACK, PYLON, or blank if nothing is there.
If a release signal is sent to a pylon or rack station and a store present
indication is still there after the signal is removed, a HUNG legend will
appear. However, in the case of the rack, this does not occur until all
subsequent stores have been sent a release signal.

A/G TRAINING WEAPONS MODE

The PACS training mode works in both A/A and A/G, giving the capability
to simulate any weapons delivery with or without stores actually loaded
aboard. However, the training mode may not prevent the release of real
ordnance (live or inert). The A/G TRNG mode should not be used when
carrying releasable stores. The A/A TRNG mode may be used when
carrying certain releasable stores; restrictions will be discussed in your
flight briefings.

The A/G training mode can be entered anytime “A/G TRNG” shows beside
PB #15. First press PB #15 with the top level PACS menu showing. This
boxes A/G TRNG, enabling the A/G training mode (Figure D-14).

Next, press PB #7, A/G LOAD. All these displays look just about the same
as the actual weapons’ displays except that the A/G TRNG legend is boxed
and the page title shows “A/G Training Weapon Load.” Once in A/G
LOAD, program munitions/stores as desired; the range of choices is made
available by paging through the groups with the STEP button. The
operation is done just as explained previously for actual A/G weapon
programming.

In A/G TRNG, whenever a munition or store is programmed, its quantity
initializes to the maximum number that can be carried on that station,
i.e., six MK-82s on station 2. Cycling PB #6, DECR QTY (a training only
legend), decreases the quantity of each boxed munition by one (Figure
D-15). Depressing the button with “1” showing takes the quantity back to
the maximum.

JETTISON AND MANUAL RELEASE
Selective Jettison

The PACS has several ways to jettison A/G stores from the aircraft, which
in all cases come off unarmed. For the circuitry to work, the pylon, rack or
CFT Bomb Release Unit (BRU) must have ejector carts installed;
otherwise, the firing signal is sent, but nothing happens. In addition, the
landing gear handle must be up or the armament safety switch in
OVERRIDE for the selective jettison circuits to be energized. Nuclear
weapons cannot be jettisoned using the combat jettison (CBT JETT)
options. When presented on an MPCD, the jettison symbology is colored
blue for discrimination.

NOTE

The combat jettison program is displayed in training and is
reprogrammable for the training mode display. However, when

CBT JETT is performed, the system exits training mode and
jettisons actual stores loaded and programmed in the nontraining
mode.

Combat Jettison

The two combat jettison options give a preprogrammed means to
selectively jettison a part of the A/G load (including fuel tanks) and retain
the rest. This could be very handy if you are intercepted en route to the
target and need to run or fight but want to retain some air-to-ground
capability.

Next, choose RACK, STORE, or PYLON (they are mutually exclusive) (8).
These options and their function are detailed below.

RACK Jettisons whatever is loaded on the pylon, i.e., a single bomb,
a bomb rack (multiple ejector rack - MER; or triple ejector
rack - TER).

STORE Jettisons a single store from a pylon or ripple jettisons stores

from a bomb rack at 66 +6 ms intervals (the rack remains) or
ripple jettisons the stores from a CFT.

PYLON Jettisons the pylon with anything attached to it.

To perform a combat jettison operation (landing gear handle up or
armament safety switch in OVERRIDE), the pilot places the selective
jettison knob on the armament control panel to COMBAT. This action
boxes CBT 1 and CBT 2 on the A/G or A/A display to indicate the selection
(Figure D-20). Then by pressing the selective jettison button once, the
stores in the CBT 1 program are jettisoned. The second depression of the
button jettisons the stores in the CBT 2 program. The station inventory is
updated after each release. Keep the jettison button depressed until all
selected stores are jettisoned.

If the jettison knob is rotated back to the off position after the CBT 1
stores are jettisoned, the program will re-initialize to the CBT 1 program;
two depressions will then be required to jettison the CBT 2 stores.

Another way of getting rid of on-board stores is by using the A/G or A/A
selective jettison options. By placing the selective jettison knob to either
A/G or A/A, the A/G or A/A selective jettison display is called up on any
MPD/MPCD that has a PACS format displayed and on the FCP MPCD.
The A/G format is similar to the combat jettison programming format; the
“A/G JETTISON” legend verifies which display the pilot has selected

The stores loaded are shown at the top and the appropriate suspension
option is boxed. If there are single stores or stores on racks on board, it
initializes to STORE, as indicated by it being boxed. If empty racks
remain, it initializes to RACK, and if only empty pylons are installed, it
goes to PYLON. Select the option desired, if different than the one boxed,
and then select the item(s) you want to jettison by pressing the adjacent
button. With the landing gear handle up or the armament safety switch
in OVERRIDE, press the selective jettison button and, after a 65 ms delay
for safing, all boxed items should depart the aircraft. If a CFT station and
the wing station next to it are both selected, the CFT stores are jettisoned
first, followed about 65 ms later by the other station. The store type and
quantity readouts are also updated. When the jettison operation is
complete, move the knob back to OFF and displays return to the original

and nuclear weapons is covered in other lessons.

Emergency Jettison

If the need arises to jettison all carted stores, racks and pylons from the
aircraft immediately, the emergency jettison circuitry is the way. Keep
the jettison button depressed until all stores are jettisoned (Figure D-22).
During emergency jettison, bomb pairs are jettisoned from each CFT (two
bombs from LC and two from RC) when the CFT releases occur. With the

CFT fully loaded, the bomb pairs are positions 1/4, 3/6, and 2/5. The
pairing may be affected if the CFT is not fully loaded. The interval
between releases of bomb pairs from a CFT is 140+20 msec. Emergency
jettison pulse timing is as follows:

The following includes two exceptions that will not be jettisoned:

1. pylons and CFT stations without ejectors carts installed, and

2. nuclear weapons with their BRUs locked.

It is important to remember that any time internal or external power is
applied to the aircraft, the emergency jettison button is hot.

Manual Release

In case certain malfunctions in the PACS system do not allow normal
deliveries, there are backup means of releasing A/G weapons armed. Two
positions on the armament control panel, MAN FF and MAN RET, bypass
many computer and display circuits giving both a free fall and retarded
manual delivery capability.

MAN FF - manual freefall position selects a manual store release and
nose-only fuzing option. While the pickle button is held down, a release
pulse train of 35 ms on and 35 ms off is generated (one pulse every 70 ms).
Each pulse releases one weapon from each selected station (Figure D-23).

MAN RET - manual retard position selects a manual store release and tail
only fuzing. The release pulse train is 115 ms on and 115 ms off (one
pulse every 230 ms); each pulse releases one weapon from each selected
station while the pickle button is depressed.

DEGRADED OPERATION

As described, the PACS has a lot of capability to deliver A/G weapons in
many combinations and configurations. When certain components of the
PACS or related systems fail, some capability is lost but, in most cases, a
backup exists. The following information addresses a complete failure of
the particular item; partial failures probably will leave some reduced
capability in the PACS area affected.

Central Computer Failure

If the CC fails, the program functions of the PACS are lost. However, A/G
weapons can still be released using MAN FF or MAN RET and A/G
selective jettison and emergency jettison can be performed.

Multipurpose Display Processor

The MPDP processes the display signals. If it fails, all MPD/MPCDs
appear blank. Manual release modes can be commanded from the FCP
MPCD and emergency jettison is still available.

MPD/MPCD

If only an individual MPD or MPCD fails, the desired PACS display can be
called up on another one in either cockpit and all functions are available.
However, if the FCP MPCD goes completely dead, the manual modes
cannot be used.

Armament Panel

If the armament panel fails, all normal PACS functions are available
except combat jettison, providing the master arm switch still works.
Manual release modes and selective jettison are lost, but emergency
jettison remains. If just the master arm switch fails, A/G and A/A weapons
cannot be released armed (but can be jettisoned safe). If both the selective
jettison knob/button and the master arm switch fail, emergency jettison is
all that remains.

Weapon Release Button

If one pickle button fails, try the one in the other cockpit. Jettison
functions are available if both fail.

INTRODUCTION

The programmable armament control system (PACS) provides the
capability for load and release programming, arming, monitoring, and
releasing/firing of air-to-surface and air-to-air munitions. The system is
made up of computers and processors (CC, MPDP, PACS), wiring,
displays, controls and carriage stations. It is software programmable,
which allows for easy updating and has an extensive built-in test (BIT)
feature that isolates faults down to the specific module for simplified,
rapid repair. This lesson addresses air-to-ground munitions. Air-to-air
and nuclear operations are covered in separate lessons.

A/G COMBAT WEAPON LOAD PROGRAMMING

There are a couple of reasons to tell the computers what is actually on
board. For one thing, the overload warning system (OWS) uses the data
to compute over-G warning information; if it bases its calculations on
incorrect data, the pilot could overstress the plane without knowing it.
Also, the computer uses the ballistics for whatever weapon is entered,
which could make for some interesting scores if programmed for “high
drags” when really carrying “slicks.”

The PACS is also smart in that it does not allow programming
store/station incompatibilities. For example, it knows that GBU-15s
cannot be carried on CF'Ts, so it does not allow the crew to load them
there.

Stations and Quantities

The five air-to-ground weapons stations correspond to PBs #16-20 at the
top of the display (Figure D-1). The number of munitions present on a
station is automatically identified to the PACS. Some stores, like fuel
tanks, self-identify their type. However, the crew normally has to identify

other stores, either through MC/DTM programming or the PACS A/G
LOAD format.

Loading Controls

On the A/G LOAD format, the legends opposite PBs #1-5 and #12-14 are
the specific A/G munitions that can be loaded. Figure D-1 shows the
options available in group 1. The load display will initialize to the group
that was last viewed on for the previous mission. There are six groups
(pages) containing all the munitions for which the PACS has a program.
All six groups are listed in TO 1F-15E-34-1-1. Note the “NONE” by PB #1.
It is used to clear legends under PBs #16-20 in the training mode. There
are also three “SUU-20” legends; SUU-20M is for MK-106s (high drags),
SUU-20N is for BDU-338s (low drags), and SUU-20 is programmable for a
mixed load. SUU-20 dispensers are discussed in detail in AGW-1.
Alternate depressions of PB #10 (STEP) pages through the six groups.
From each A/G load display, it is also possible to change to A/A LOAD by
pressing PB #8, enter the A/G TRNG mode by pressing PB #15, or return
to the top level PACS menu by pressing PB #11. Entering NUC LOAD at
PB #9 is possible only on the top level PACS menu.
