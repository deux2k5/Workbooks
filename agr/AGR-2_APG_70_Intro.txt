Cursor Function Select (PB #7)

Determines which of five cursor functions can be commanded.

MAP

UPDT

TGT

CUE

MARK

Creates a high resolution patch map centered on the
cursor.

Updates the mission navigator (MN) and/or inertial
navigation system with reference to cursor position and
the latitude/longitude of the sequence point at PB #17.

Designates the location of the cursor as a target or target
offset, cues the TGT IR to the target and inputs ranging
information to the CC for weapons delivery computations.

Directs the TGT IR to the current cursor location.

Stores the latitude, longitude and altitude (if available) of
the cursor position and time of the mark for later use.

Display Window Selected (PB #8)

Eight HRM patch map sizes (.67, 1.3, 3.3, 4.7, 10, 20, 40 and 80 nm
square) and a blank size are selectable via HOTAS only. PB #8 is not
functional. An outline (display window) of the selected patch map size is
also displayed on the radar to show the area to be encompassed if a map is
commanded. If a smaller size is commanded with .67 preselected, the
display window (DW) size blanks and the display window is no longer
displayed. When a map is commanded with the size blank, the map size is
based on cursor position as follows.

CURSOR POSITION DW SIZE
2.7nm- 50nm 3.38 nm
50.0nm- 80nm 4.7nm
80.0 nm - 160 nm 10.0 nm

Antenna Azimuth Scan Select (PB #9)

Three different scans (FULL, HALF and QTR) are selectable (in all cursor
functions) and displayed at PB #9 (Figure D-2). Depressing and releasing
PB #9 changes the scan from FULL (100°) to HALF (50°) to QTR (25°)
(Figure D-2). Partial scan (HALF/QTR) is centered on the cursor and is
slewable within the total radar sweep limits (such that the outer limit of
the partial scan cannot exceed + 50° of the aircraft velocity vector). In
FREEZE, the azimuth legend change inputs are ignored until FREEZE is
deselected. A change of radar modes returns the scan to FULL if HALF or
QTR was selected.

Interleaved Ground Moving Target IGMT) Mode (PB #10)
This mode is discussed later in detail.

Patch Map Timer

This is displayed below the gray scale and only in the MAP cursor
function. It shows the time required from commanding a patch map to
actual display of the map. When a patch map is commanded, the timer
will count down and at zero, the patch map is displayed. The estimated
time to go is only displayed when a DW is selected and the cursor is over a
mappable location.

Bull’s-eye

Magnetic bearing and ground range from the selected bull’s-eye point
(UFC Menu 2) to the cursor.

Radar Range Select (PBs #13 and #14)

Six radar ranges (4.7, 10, 20, 40, 80 and 160 nm) are selectable (all cursor
functions) via PBs #13 and #14. Ranges can be increased/decreased in the
RCP by moving the auto acq switch forward to decrease or aft to increase
when the trigger is half action. The following chart lists RBM resolutions
as a function of range.

IPVU (Interleaved Precision Velocity Update) (PB #16)

The IPVU legend is only displayed in the RBM, HRM PPI and HRM
“patch” radar modes. It is only selectable in the MAP cursor function,
although once selected it is functional in all cursor functions. Once
selected (boxed), whenever the radar is functioning in RBM, HRM PPI or
HRM patch modes (except during actual map construction), the A/G radar
is scheduled to automatically perform a 5-second, four-antenna position
PVU every minute. During the PVU the radar video is not refreshed,
IPVU appears above PB #6 and the resulting INS Vs radar deltas are
automatically accepted by the MN. When IPVU is selected, the results of
the most recent PVU are displayed below the boxed IPVU legend.

Selecting IPVU frees the aircrew from manually selecting the PVU mode,
thus keeping the system velocities accurate with minimum aircrew
attention. Conversely, since the IPVU only occurs while the radar is
functioning in the RBM/HRM modes, if the aircrew elects to use the radar
in the air-to-air mode, the IPVU is not performed. Also, the accuracy of a
dedicated PVU (eight antenna positions) versus that of the IPVU (four
antenna positions) dictate that a dedicated PVU be performed prior to
constructing an HRM patch map prior to an update or designation.

NOTE
If the mode is changed while IPVU is boxed, the IPVU numbers at
PB #16 are removed until a new IPVU is accomplished.

Sequence Point Indicator (PB #17)

The sequence point indicator displays the currently selected radar
sequence point. Pressing PB #17 or selecting quick step with the FCP
coolie switch or RCP castle switch cycles the selected SP among the points
currently displayed on the radar based on range. The sequence point can
also be changed by typing the number in the UFC scratchpad and
pressing PB #17 (or quick stepping with a point in the scratchpad). If
changed via the UFC and the point is not within the selected radar
footprint, the display window/cursor is latched at the top of the scope.
However, azimuth and range readouts at the top left will be to the
sequence point. It is important to note that if the cursor is manually
moved (TDC) after being stepped (UFC/PB #17, cycling PB #17, or
HOTAS), the cursor will not be latched to the sequence point (and the
azimuth and range readouts will be to the cursor but not to the sequence
point).

D-7 AGR-2


Text from AGR-2_APG_70_Intro_page_14.jpeg:
NOTE

If a map is commanded from the TSD, the sequence point number at

PB #17 on the A/G radar display blanks with the new map and
remains blank until the aircrew selects a new sequence point.

SNF (Sniff) (PB #18)

SNF is a receive only mode used to detect jamming or to provide minimum
radar radiation times. It is selectable in RBM, GMT, HRM, PVU and
BCN modes. All cursor functions are available but ground returns are not
present. For a more detailed discussion of SNF, refer to

TO 1F-15E-34-1-1-1.

Radar Frequency Select (PBs #19 and #20)

The radar channel and frequency (A-E and 1-8, respectively) are displayed
below PB #19. These 32 different selections allow aircraft within a flight
to avoid interference with each other or from external jamming. Channels
are changed with PB #20 and frequencies, with PB #19. The selected A/G
channel is not carried over to the A/A radar modes. However, the selected
A/A channel is carried over to the A/G modes. For a detailed discussion of
the radar channels, refer to TO 1F-15E-34-1-1-1.

Antenna Elevation

Antenna elevation is automatically controlled to cover 60% of the selected
radar range based on altitude. It can be moved manually using trigger
half action and TDC up/down (RCP) or throttle elevation wheel (FCP) in
RBM, GMT and BCN only, but when moved, it may remain in the same
position until moved again. Selecting a larger range scale recalculates the
antenna elevation based on the new range, while smaller range scale
selections attempt to keep the same area illuminated. If the antenna
elevation is manually positioned above the horizon, weather mapping is
assumed. Subsequent range scale changes do not change the elevation
until it is positioned below the horizon.

Ground Moving Target (GMT) Mode (PB #6)

The objective of GMT is the detection of ground moving targets (e.g., truck
convoys). Eventually, target acquisition, tracking and AGM-65 EO IR
missile handoff operations with multiple missile launch will be possible.
Only target detection operations can be accomplished at this
time. The GMT radar mode can be selected as a dedicated mode with no
map background (GMT) or can be selected during RBM operations as an
RBM-GMT interleaved mode (IGMT). Approximately 90-100 detections
can be displayed out to a maximum range of 32 nm. If more than the
allowed symbols are present, the oldest detections are deleted and only
the newest are retained.

Dedicated GMT

GMT can be entered using PB #6 and presents ground moving targets in
the form of plus (+) symbols on a PPI scan format (Figure D-8).

EL Bar Selection (PB #3)

This button allows selection of the number of elevation bars (sweeps, 1-4)
to be included in the frame. At GMT mode entry, the antenna elevation is
positioned so that the top of the radar beam matches the far limit of the
selected range scale. For example, with a 20 nm scale selected, the top of
the GMT beam will be set at 20 nm. The range at the bottom of the beam
depends on aircraft altitude. With multiple bars selected (two or more)
the radar scans from the nearest to the farthest range so that the closer
targets are observed first. For example, with 1-bar selected, if the current
beam coverage is 15-32 nm, selecting 2-bar will increase coverage to

8-32 nm. The first bar will cover 8-15 nm and the second bar will cover
15-32 nm. Selecting 3- or 4-bar will further increase the total range
coverage. Specific range coverage depends on aircraft altitude, antenna
tilt angle and the number of bars selected.

GMT Error Messages

GMT processing can be automatically halted when certain conditions
arise. If the condition requires that GMT processing cease to reinitialize
the frame, FRAME ABORT is displayed. If the condition requires that all
GMT mode processing halt indefinitely, NO GMT is displayed. The
possible error conditions are

e RANGE/ELEV LIMIT - Attempt to process GMTs outside of
elevation or range limits.

e AZ GIMBAL LIMIT - Attempt to process GMTs outside of
azimuth limits.

e PROCESSING ERROR - Internal GMT processing error.

NOTE

The maximum GMT coverage is 32 nm. Therefore, with a 40 nm radar
range selected, the top of the radar beam will be set at 32 nm.

Cursor Functions (PB #7)

Similar to RBM but no update function available.

Antenna Elevation

Manual antenna elevation control commands are similar to RBM HOTAS.

Antenna Azimuth Scan Select (PB #9)

This function is mechanized just as it is in RBM (previously discussed).

Range (PBs #13 and #14)

Ranges available are 4.7, 10, 20 and 40 nm. Mode entry with a range
selection of greater than 40 nm initializes to 40 nm. When the range
selection is 40, the “up” button is not available. The HOTAS is similar to
RBM. Ground moving targets can only be detected/displayed out to

32 nm.

Freeze

The operator may command freeze. The GMT scan halts immediately and
targets remain on the display at the fixed location.

GMT Range Coverage Circles and Asterisks

The radar displays range cues (small circles) along the displayed ground
track line that represent GMT minimum and maximum range coverage
with the selected el bar setting. In addition to the range cues, asterisk
cues are used to indicate the current GMT scan coverage on the current el
bar. The lower asterisk always represents the minimum scan coverage for
the frame. The upper asterisk represents the maximum range of the
current bar. The cue steps out in range as each (subsequent) bar is
scanned.

GMT Additional Target Indicators

In GMT, the entire + 50° scan is processed, although the farthest range
portions of the extreme azimuths are off the edge of the display. Detected
targets that are AZ limited are indicated by a triangle oriented to point
outboard, toward the limited targets.

Interleaved Ground Moving Target

Interleaved GMT is entered by selecting PB #10 while in RBM mode with
a display range less than 80 nm selected. IGMT is not available and the
legend is not displayed if the selected range is 80 or 160 nm. A “frame”
consists of a single sweep of RBM followed by one or more GMT sweeps,
depending on el bar selection.

Freeze

Freeze mechanization is the same as GMT except: 1) an RBM scan would
be completed before the freeze, 2) when freeze is deselected, processing
starts with a new RBM frame and 3) manual EL commands are ignored
during freeze.

IGMT range coverage circles, additional target indicators and error
messages are the same as dedicated GMT. Selection of IFF interrogation
suspends the GMT portion of the IGMT for the duration of the
interrogation. IFF symbology is removed when the GMT frame restarts.

High Resolution Map (HRM) Mode

The HRM mode uses synthetic array radar mapping to provide the
increased mapping resolution for improved target detection and accurate
long-range designations. The HRM is displayed in both PPI and patch
map formats. The PPI format (Figure D-5) is similar to the RBM format
except for the doppler notch (an area 8° either side of the velocity vector
where video is not displayed) and that it does not provide a “real time”
radar picture due to the delay required for doppler processing. HRM
ranges are the same as RBM; however, HRM resolution is significantly
better than RBM. HRM takes up to 18 seconds per sweep, vice 1 second
for RBM, and like the RBM display, up to five sequence points can be
presented. HRM patch maps provide greatly enhanced resolution and
magnify selected areas for navigation updates and target designations.

Patch Map Modes

The following functions are available when a patch map is made
(Figure D-7, page D-17).

Map Stabilizing Options (PB #2)

Two options are available: PRG (progressive) and STB (stabilized). In
PRG the azimuth and range, from the aircraft to the area being mapped,
remain the same, while in STB, a specific ground point is continuously
mapped. The radar initializes to STB; PRG can be selected via PB #2.
PRG is essentially a reconnaissance function in that it constructs maps in
a strip map way as the mapped area “snowplows’” along the area being
mapped.

Antenna Azimuth Scan Select (PB #9)

Azimuth scans are centered on the last map center and are the same as
PPI (i.e., if the scan in PPI restricts the horizontal boundaries of the map,
those areas are not displayed when the map is made). If a patch map is
commanded from a PPI display (RBM or HRM), a FULL azimuth patch
map will be made unless the aircrew had a reduced azimuth selected
when last exiting the HRM PATCH mode. Ifthe latter were the case, the
new patch made will be reduced azimuth.

Antenna Elevation

Is automatically centered on cursor position and for the selected range
(not adjustable).

PPI (PB #14)

Depressing the PB commands the radar to the HRM PPI format, which
initializes at the last selected PPI range.

NOTE

Anytime you reject (with the auto acq switch) out of a patch map, the
radar initializes to RBM at the last selected PPI range.

AGR-2 D-16


Text from AGR-2_APG_70_Intro_page_23.jpeg:
Recall Options

When freeze is selected in HRM (patch map format), three new options are
added to the display: (1) display brightness adjust for the most recently
constructed map, (2) a recall option and (3) store (STO). In the recall
option, the radar retains or “remembers” two patch maps labeled NEW
and OLD. Each time a new map is made (and automatically displayed),
the previously displayed map becomes the OLD map. These are recalled
alternately by depressing PB #10 (Figure D-7). The options available with

PB #10 are:

NEW

With the radar in FREEZE, NEW indicates that the

map being displayed is the most recent HRM map

created.

OLD

With the radar in FREEZE, OLD indicates that the

map being displayed is not the most recent HRM map

created.

Precision Velocity Update (PVU) Mode

The primary function of the selectable PVU mode (Figure D-9) is to
provide an estimate of velocity error for updating either the INS or MN.
An MN PVU can compensate for velocity errors of up to 150 knots from
the radar. In other words, the INS and MN (with INS input) “think” they
are moving across the surface in a certain direction and rate. This
movement is calculated from accelerations provided to the INS from
aircraft movement. The radar also calculates this movement from the
rate of change of the ground returns it sees. As the radar calculations can
be more accurate, PVU provides the crew with the delta or difference in
perceived movement by the two systems and allows an update if desired.
This delta is displayed beneath RADAR on the PVU display. This
information is also used for in-flight alignments of the INS. The PVU
mode is necessary because even small velocity errors in the INS and MN
can have a significant effect on the accuracy and quality of HRM maps
and therefore, on radar weapons delivery accuracy.

Text from AGR-2_APG_70_Intro_page_26.jpeg:
After TCTO 1F-15E-737, MN and INS PVUs are permitted in any present
position keeping source (PPKS). In embedded GPS/INS (EGI) PPKS MN
PVUs are not necessary prior to HRM patch map construction; however,
INS PVUs are still necessary after replacement of the CC, RDR antenna
or the INS.

With the PVU mode selected, the following options are displayed on the
MPD.

Doppler Bias Select (PB #2)

PB #2 displays either of two selectable options for the INS PVU. LAN or
SEA provides different bias inputs to the PVU, depending upon selection.
The PVU mode initializes with LAN selected. If flying over water, select
the SEA option. However, for MN PVUs, the LAN/SEA option is
nonfunctional. The aircrew may select either option but the PVU will
continue to function as though LAN was selected. SEA is not available
with an in-flight alignment in progress.

RST (Reset) (PB #4)

Reinitializes the PVU operation. Not selectable with an INS PVU or
in-flight alignment in progress. Selecting RST provides the same results
as exiting and then reentering the PVU mode. Prior MN velocity updates
stored in memory are not affected by RST.

CLR (Clear) (PB #5)

CLR is provided to give the operator the means to delete an MN velocity
update that may have been in error. Not selectable after PVU update is
commanded for the INS or if in an in-flight align mode.

MN (Mission Navigator) (PB #8)

MN is selected (boxed) upon PVU mode entry. The MN velocities are
updated if the operator accepts the PVU errors with MN selected.

INS Unertial Navigation System) (PB #9)

With INS boxed when the operator accepts PVU errors, the INS PVU
process begins, continuously updating the INS velocities. When update is
commanded, options displayed at PBs #4 and #5 are removed.

IFA (In-flight Alignment)

Displayed at PB #10 when INS has been cycled from OFF to NAV during
flight. With an IFA in progress, options at PBs #2, #4 and #5 are not
selectable. Utilized only when the INS has malfunctioned and needs
realigning in flight.

Beacon (BCN) Mode

The primary purpose of BCN (Figure D-10) is to use a ground-based
beacon for radar/offset bombing. Two different beacon codes can be
interrogated. The radar does not display normal video returns but instead
displays beacon location in range and azimuth. The beacon return
consists of four horizontal lines in range order. The strobe closest in range
is the actual position of the beacon. Like RBM and HRM, targets can be
designated in BCN. Peculiar BCN display controls follow.

Cursor Function Select (PB #7)

Only MAP and TGT are available in the BCN mode. The target functions
are the same as RBM. The MAP function is available only so that HOTAS
functions that are available only in MAP cursor function are usable in
BCN (mode reject to RBM, for example).

EL Bar Scan

Five different elevation scans—1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 bar scan—can be selected
via PB #15 to facilitate beacon detection.

Air-to-Ground Ranging (AGR)

The air-to-ground ranging mode provides slant range information for
weapons delivery computations and position updates. The radar slant
range is displayed in digital form on the A/G radar format and on the
HUD above the NAV data block. Radar slant range is also displayed on
the HUD A/G reticle via an analog bar (large reticle) or an analog cue
(small reticle) (Figure D-11). AGR is not selectable from the A/G radar
format. Its selection is a function of the type of weapons delivery or
position update, weapons delivery modes, sensor priority, etc., all of which
are discussed in later lessons.

INTRODUCTION

The F-15E A/G radar (APG-70) has five operating modes: real beam map
(RBM), ground moving targets (GMT), high resolution map (HRM), beacon
(BCN) and precision velocity update (PVU). The radar also has an
air-to-ground ranging mode (AGR).

Included in these modes is the ability to create a high resolution patch
map (MAP), perform position updates to the navigation systems (UPDT),
designate targets (TGT), cue the targeting IR (CUE) and mark the
latitude and longitude of points of interest (MARK). The A/G radar
display can only be displayed on the MPDs (not MPCDs). Table D-1
summarizes the different modes, their performance and their purpose.

RADAR MODES
Real Beam Map (RBM) (PB #6)

The purpose of RBM is to provide a conventional radar mode for ground
mapping and weather detection. The RBM format (Figure D-1) is a plan
position indicator (PPI) display, which takes approximately 1 second per
sweep and provides six ranges (from 4.7 to 160 nm). Up to five sequence
points and five mark points can be simultaneously presented on the RBM
display. The following discussion explains the pushbutton options
counterclockwise from PB #2.

DCL (Declutter) (PB #2)

DCL removes the magnetic north indicator, all sequence points and their
related numbers from the radar display. If declutter is selected and an
HRM patch map is created from RBM, it will also be decluttered. The
declutter option is selectable/deselectable in all cursor functions and all
modes except BCN.

GC (Gain Control) (PB #8)

There are four selectable gain settings, 0-3, with 0 being the lowest gain
setting and 3 being the highest. This controls intensity of radar returns
through the receiver. GC3 is recommended for normal operation.

Display Brightness Adjust (DBA) (PBs #4 and #5)

Brightness of the map display is controlled through 16 selectable levels of
brightness (0-15), provided you are not in FREEZE. Once set, brightness
will be retained for a specific mode, provided all mode changes are made
via HOTAS. Ifthe radar mode is changed by using PB #6, the brightness
level defaults to 8. An eight-shade gray scale is located in the lower right
corner of the display to aid in optimizing MPD brightness/contrast
adjustment.

Radar Mode Select (PB #6)

Individually selects the five radar modes: RBM, GMT, HRM (PPI), BCN
and PVU. HRM patch map is not selectable. Usually when PB #6 is used
to select a different radar mode, the radar range initializes to that selected
in the last PPI mode. You can also enter various A/G radar modes via
taking command of the A/G radar display, thus taking the radar from an
A/A radar mode or from AGR; or you can enter some radar modes (RBM,
PVU, HRM patch) via mode reject from another A/G radar mode. The
various mode parameters can initialize to values based on how you
selected the mode, what mode you selected from and the previous
parameters. As you move among the various A/G radar modes, you should
check the parameters, ensuring they are set correctly.
