Text from AGR-3_Modes_Controls_and_Displays_page_10.jpeg:
E Azimuth scan caret - indicates actual position of antenna.

F Azimuth limit balls - are positioned by the radar and provide a
reference for the azimuth scan limits. The azimuth limit balls
are not limited to the +60° antenna limits, but may extend past
the azimuth tic marks to the edge of the format. They are
displayed in the GMT, HRM and BCN modes only.

G Range arcs - provided on RBM, HRM PPI, GMT and A/G BCN
displays. The arcs represent 25, 50, 75 and 100% of the selected
range scale.

H Zero azimuth line - is displayed by the radar on the RBM, GMT
and BCN formats. Since the radar returns are displayed drift
stabilized up to +10° of drift, the line can be used as a ground
track reference.

I BIT window area - is located on the lower left side of the A/G
format and is used to display mode, restart and BIT information.
The window displays PVU when IPVU is selected during RBM or
HRM and the radar is performing PVU. It also displays RNG
when the radar is in the air-to-ground ranging mode. Located
above the BIT window area is an arrow indicating magnetic
north. The magnetic north arrow can rotate as required and will
freeze when patch map is commanded. The arrow is removed
when declutter is selected.

positioned by the crew or the CC depending on the specific cursor
function selected.

K_ PPI gray scale - provides a gray scale consisting of 8 shades of
gray imbedded in the radar RBM and HRM PPI map video. It is
used to adjust the video display for the best brightness and
contrast.

L_ Map time-to-go indicator - estimates how long the radar will take
to construct an HRM patch map. It is displayed only in cursor
function MAP, with a display window (DW) selected and the
cursor within mappable radar limits.

M BE bearing/range indicator - is displayed in the lower right
corner on the A/G radar display. The data is from the selected
bullseye point to the cursor.

Text from AGR-3_Modes_Controls_and_Displays_page_12.jpeg:
O Azimuth (Az), range (R) and altitude (ALT) - indicate cursor
position on the radar display in relation to the aircraft. ALT is
displayed in RBM only and defines the radar altitude coverage at
the range of the cursor. ALT is normally used only for weather
detection/assessment.

P Mark points (V) - indicate positions that have been marked by
performing an overfly mark via the UFC, a radar mark via the
A/G radar display or an automatic overfly mark when the
weapon release button is depressed. A maximum of ten positions
can be marked and stored. If an eleventh position is marked,
mark point 1 is overwritten. A maximum of five mark points can
be displayed at any one time. There is no provision for
sequencing to mark points on the A/G radar display. Mark points
cannot be deleted. Some types of weapons deliveries create mark
points at the target. If a radar target is cluttered with mark
points created by previous weapons deliveries, pushing the UFC
keypad mark button (M) will delete those mark points by
repositioning them to the current aircraft position.

Q Display window - indicates the area covered by a patch map if
commanded.

R_ No map cue - an “X” through the display window indicates the
selected patch map is unavailable under present conditions.

A/G RADAR HANDS ON CONTROLS

Many functions of the air-to-ground radar are controlled by using the stick
and throttles in the FCP and the hand controllers in the RCP.

Front Cockpit Control Stick

The auto acq switch on the front cockpit control stick provides access to
several A/G radar features. Its exact function depends on the selected
cursor function (Figure D-10).

Text from AGR-3_Modes_Controls_and_Displays_page_21.jpeg:
In general, mode reject (in MAP cursor function) takes the A/G radar to
RBM unless already in RBM (Figure D-11). Mode reject to RBM resets
the radar range to that selected in the last PPI mode (HRM or RBM).
Mode reject from RBM takes the radar to PVU. (Exception: If the
sequence point at PB #17 is changed on the PVU display, mode reject then
results in a patch map being constructed of the sequence point.)

Front Cockpit Throttles

Five switches on the throttles (Figure D-12) affect the A/G radar: coolie
switch, TDC, laser fire, el wheel and boat switch.

Coolie Switch

UP quick steps the cursor between displayed sequence points (any except
MARK) in range order regardless of radar mode or cursor function. The
sequence point number under PB #17 also changes to match cursor
position. When the cursor position has been moved to the farthest
displayed point, the next UP movement of the coolie switch causes SP to
be displayed at PB #17 and the cursor goes to the center of the MPD.
Subsequent movements of the coolie switch start the entire sequence over
again, beginning with the closest displayed sequence point.

NOTE

The coolie switch does not position the cursor over MARK points.

When in the PVU mode, sequence points change in numerical order and
the only indication of cursor movement is the sequence point displayed
under PB #17 and the cursor azimuth and range change.

Text from AGR-3_Modes_Controls_and_Displays_page_23.jpeg:
TDC

The TDC is used to move cursor position (all PB #7 cursor functions) and

controls the pattern steering line (TGT cursor function and a target

designated). Depressing and releasing the TDC performs the following

action based on the selected cursor function:

MAP Commands an HRM patch map at the current cursor position.

TGT Designates the current cursor position as a target. When the
PSL is enabled (arrowhead), designates the PSL (arrowhead
changes to circle).

UPDT Commands a position update for the MN and/or INS/MN based
on the currently selected sequence point (displayed under PB
#17) and the current cursor position.

MARK _ Labels the current cursor position as a mark point.

CUE Cues the TGT IR to the current cursor position.

The TDC also commands the system to accept a MN PVU, when PVU is
selected at PB #6.

Boat Switch

Aft undesignates the pattern steering line and/or ground target if in the
A/G master mode and not in command of the A/A radar display.

El Wheel
The el wheel changes antenna elevation in the RBM and GMT modes.

Laser Fire Button

Depressing and releasing the laser fire switch freezes/unfreezes the radar
in RBM, HRM (PPI or patch map) and GMT.

Castle Switch

Forward selects MAP, right selects UPDT (except in GMT), aft selects
TGT, and left selects CUE and MARK. Depressing and releasing quick
steps the cursor, in range order, over displayed sequence points. When
the cursor position has been moved to the farthest displayed point, the
next depression of the castle switch causes SP to be displayed at PB #17
and the cursor goes to the center of the MPD. A subsequent depression of
the castle switch starts the entire sequence over again, beginning with the
closest displayed sequence point.

AGR-3 D-18


Text from AGR-3_Modes_Controls_and_Displays_page_25.jpeg:
TDC

The TDC moves cursor position and (in TGT cursor function) controls the
pattern steering line when enabled. Antenna elevation is changed by
holding the trigger half action and depressing the rim of the TDC.
Depressing the forward edge raises the antenna and depressing the back
edge lowers it. When in FREEZE, depressing and releasing the TDC with
the trigger half action EXPANDS the HRM patch map display.

Trigger
Full action and release is used to command the selected cursor function.
In conjunction with other switches, the trigger performs the following

functions:

@ Half action (HA) on the trigger with TDC rim pressure controls
RBM/BCN/GMT antenna elevation in MAP.

@ HA on the trigger with auto acq forward/aft selects RBM/HRM
PPI/GMT range scale in all cursor functions.

@ HA on the trigger followed by TDC pressed/released, when in FREEZE,
performs the EXPAND option while in MAP with STO not selected
(HRM patch map only).

Laser Fire Button

Depressing and releasing the laser fire button freezes/unfreezes the radar.

D-19 AGR-3


Text from AGR-3_Modes_Controls_and_Displays_page_26.jpeg:
Auto Acq Switch

Auto acq function is dependent on the cursor function selected. In MAP,
moving the auto acq switch forward reduces the selected display window
size and aft increases display window size. If the trigger is held half
action, moving the auto acq switch forward selects smaller radar ranges
and aft selects larger ranges. If the auto acq is depressed and released
(map cursor function), the radar changes modes with the same logic that
applies to the FCP auto acq (Figure D-14). Mode reject to RBM resets the
radar range to that last selected in RBM. In TGT, alternately pulling aft
enables or disenables the PSL (if the target is designated) and depressing
and releasing it undesignates the PSL and/or the target. The auto acq
switch has no effect in MARK or CUE cursor functions.

PROCEDURES AND LIMITS

This section covers required procedures to detect ground moving targets
(GMT), create HRM patch maps, update the INS/MN using the A/G radar,
designate targets for weapon delivery, cue the targeting pod, and mark
points. Limitations associated with each are addressed, and additional
features such as FREEZE, EXPAND and SET are also discussed.

GMT/IGMT Mode

In this mode, the A/G radar detects ground moving targets (e.g., trucks,
convoys, Scuds). Targets can be detected out to 32 nm. Dedicated GMT
has no map background. Interleaved GMT (IGMT) is an interleaved
technique to present moving targets on a mapped background. Selecting
GMT at PB #6 commands dedicated GMT. Boxing IGMT at PB #10
interleaves moving target detection with mapping (Figure D-15).

Figure D - 16. Map Cursor Function.

Position the cursor. This can be done using the TDC, but initially it is
done by quick stepping to the desired sequence point. This ensures that
the cursor is placed at the same latitude and longitude as the sequence
point. More importantly, the sequence point under PB #17 also matches
the point you have stepped to, so the CC is informed concerning which
point is being referenced.

Select the desired display window (DW) size using the auto acq switch.
Ensure area to be mapped is:

@ not within 8° either side of the velocity vector (blind zone)

@ not more than 60° off the velocity vector (gimbal limit)

@ within the minimum and maximum ranges for the selected display
window size (DW range limit):

D-27 AGR-3


Text from AGR-3_Modes_Controls_and_Displays_page_34.jpeg:
The quality of patch maps can be improved by:

@ ensuring the velocities are accurate; velocity errors equate to
inaccurate information provided to the radar and the CC.
Accomplishing a PVU just prior to making maps is the best method.

After TCTO 1F-15E-737 with EGI as the present position keeping
source (PPKS), MN PVUs are not necessary to update velocities prior
to constructing patch maps. However, INS PVUs will still be necessary
to correct any radar pointing errors that may be present.

@ having the area to be mapped at least 30° off the nose.
@ making the map at the closest range practical.
@ making the map while at high airspeed and straight-and-level.

@ climbing to an altitude that provides an antenna graze angle greater
than 1°.

Conversely, maps made near the blind zone take longer, are not as
accurate, are of poorer quality, and are much more sensitive to
maneuvering/slow airspeed.

Freeze
Autofreeze

Autofreeze is commanded when less than 75% of the selected map area is
mappable. An AUTO FREEZE cue is displayed in the upper half of the
HRM display format. With no operator intervention, the system waits for
the point to become mappable again. At that time, AUTO FREEZE is
removed and mapping automatically commences. If automatic return to
mapping is not desired, the operator should manually select FREEZE.

Manual Freeze

The capability to freeze the current radar video is available in all cursor
functions.

RBM Freeze (Figure D-19). Selecting FREEZE halts continuous mapping
following completion of the current RBM sweep and allows the operator to
keep the current RBM video indefinitely. An HRM patch map commanded
from a frozen RBM is also frozen.

If a map is commanded while in FREEZE, a single map is constructed and
displayed, followed by a return to FREEZE. FREEZE is typically selected
for any cursor function that requires accurate cursor placement (TGT,
UPDT). Any time the operator stops continuous HRM mapping by

the available area is expanded and the cursor is located off center at the
correct latitude and longitude. EXPAND should be accomplished after the

Position Updating

The MN or INS/MN present position can be updated from RBM, HRM PPI
or patch map formats. Procedures for all three are the same. The update
requires that the cursor is positioned over the radar video as accurately as
possible. For this reason, a patch map is usually used to accomplish an
update. (See Figure D-25 for patch map symbology.)

Figure D - 25. MN Update.

Select the UPDT cursor function. IPVU (adjacent to PB #16) is replaced
by MN with N/S and E/W errors displayed in feet; however, if either error
exceeds 3000 feet, both are displayed in miles to the nearest tenth. The
INS/MN uses the latitude and longitude of the point listed under PB #17
and compares that to the actual cursor position to determine INS/MN
errors. Pressing PB #16 allows toggling between INS and MN. In HRM
patch map with INS selected, the counter displayed above PB #7 UPDT
legend represents the time (seconds) remaining before the current HRM
map is too old for an INS position update (90 seconds from map
construction, Figure D-26). The counter is not displayed with MN selected
at PB #16.

D- 35 AGR-3


Text from AGR-3_Modes_Controls_and_Displays_page_42.jpeg:
The UPDT cursor function defaults to MN because the mission navigator
computer routine is more flexible and “more forgiving” than the INS when
it comes to updates. For instance, if the aircrew makes a position update
mistake to the MN, it can easily be corrected by accomplishing a MN
RESET via the UFC, correcting whatever error was made on the previous
attempt, and then performing another update. If the aircrew makes an
update error with INS selected, there is NO WAY to remove the position
update once it has been entered. Because of this, MN updates, instead of
INS, are usually accomplished.

Position the cursor over the update point. Once the map is created and
you are satisfied with the image, select FREEZE. This prevents the radar
display from “jumping” when the next patch map is created. Use the TDC
as required to “fine tune” the cursor position.

Ensure cursor position matches the sequence point listed under PB #17.
Again, quick stepping to the sequence point before making a patch map
eliminates the mismatch error. If it is incorrect or displays SP, type the
correct sequence point number in the UFC scratch pad and press PB #17
(or quickstep to the correct sequence point).

Prior to updating ensure:

@ asystem update is not being accomplished using another method (an
MN position update using the UFC, for instance).

@ the timer above the cursor function has not counted down to zero (INS
only).

Text from AGR-3_Modes_Controls_and_Displays_page_43.jpeg:
Command the update. “UPDATE” is displayed for 5 seconds. During a
MN position update, errors are zeroed out and the sequence point symbols
are repositioned to the cursor (Figure D-26). During an INS position
update, the errors decrease but they do not zero and the sequence point
symbol will not move all the way to the cursor due to Kalman filtering of
the update.

If a MN update was accepted and subsequently determined to be bad, the
MN can be reset on the UFC update select submenu (MN RESET).

NOTE

If the INS is selected as the PP keeping source (on the UFC) and the MN is
updated, HUD/ADI/HSI/TSD etc. NAV information is not affected. If the
MN is selected as the PP source on the UFC and the MN is updated,
HUD/ADI/HSI/TSD etc. steering will change. Sequence point symbols on
the A/G radar display are always repositioned when either MN or INS

radar update is performed. If a target has been designated prior to the
update, the designated target symbology is not repositioned. After
TCTO 1F-15-737, if the EGI is the PPKS, sequence point symbols will be
placed by the EGI. Radar position updates should not be necessary with
the EGI selected as the PPKS.

Text from AGR-3_Modes_Controls_and_Displays_page_44.jpeg:
To update the INS, the procedures are the same, except for depressing
PB #16 to change MN to INS (Figure D-27). The following considerations
apply:

@ Ifan INS update is accepted, both the INS and MN are updated

@ 100% of the update is accepted by the MN while only a percentage of
the update is accepted by the INS (see INS lesson for more details)

If an INS update is desired and the timer counts down to zero, there are
several ways to reinitialize the timer. In RBM, the time expiring means
the cursor needs to be repositioned in order to perform an INS position
update. In HRM, the time expiring means a new map must be
constructed to do an INS position update. Reselect MAP cursor function
and construct a new patch map.

When steering to the target other than the line of sight steering is desired,
the PSL can be positioned by the operator to the desired approach

approach to the target on the desired run-in heading, rather than line of
sight direct to the target.

NOTE

If a target offset is used to designate a target, PSL symbology is not displayed
on the target offset point; it is only displayed on the radar-designated target. If

the target is displayed within the radar video, the PSL steering can still be
enabled, slewed and designated. If the target is not displayed within the radar
video, then PSL steering is not available.

AGR-03-31

The PSL steering algorithm attempts to direct the aircraft such that the
last 15 seconds of the attack is flown wings level along the selected
heading. PSL steering uses a turn angle limit, so that if the PSL heading
is greater than approximately +80° off the target line of sight bearing,
PSL steering is replaced with straight in steering (the HUD bank steering
bar is replaced with the azimuth steering line). A level weapon delivery is
assumed when bombing with a designated PSL. The HUD pull up cue
and TPULL (time to pull) are not displayed.

AGR-3 D - 42


Text from AGR-3_Modes_Controls_and_Displays_page_49.jpeg:
In short, HUD PSL steering is not available if PSL heading differs from
target direct steering by more than 30° or if more than 60° of bank is
needed to roll the aircraft on the requested run-in by 15 seconds prior to
computed weapons release.

PSL undesignate is performed in the same manner as a target
undesignate (cursor function TGT and mode reject). To undesignate the
target (after the PSL is undesignated), the undesignate action must be
performed a second time. When the target is undesignated, all attack
steering is removed from the HUD. PSL/target undesignate can be
accomplished in the front cockpit by moving the boat switch aft (must be
in the A/G master mode) and not in command of the A/A radar.

achieved by entering MX (x=1-10) as the current aircraft sequence point
(PB #10 on UFC Menu 1 or Data 1). Some types of weapons deliveries
create mark points at the target location. If the radar target is cluttered
with mark points created by previous weapons deliveries, pressing the
UFC key pad mark button will remove them, by resetting them to the
aircraft position. Aircrews will, as technique, sometimes use this
procedure to put all the stored mark points from previous sorties in the

RADAR NAVIGATION
Preflight

Predictions of update points, targets and offsets should be obtained from
the best available source: photos, AFMSS or drawings. Remember that
attack and ingress routes significantly impact radar display presentations
and you may only get one chance.

Whenever possible, select aim points, offsets, etc. that will be well outside
the blind zone during the route leg or target run. Ideally, you should
make HRM patch maps when the point is at least 30° off the nose.
Because of the nature of Synthetic Aperture Radar, such maps can be
constructed more quickly and are more accurate than maps made near the
blind zone. Between 30-50° is the HRM “sweet spot” (Figure D-39).

When determining the altitude to map from, you must consider two
factors: radar line of sight (LOS) and graze angle. LOS is limited by the
curvature of the earth and by intervening obstacles, such as hills and
ridge lines. Table D-1 shows the maximum LOS range over flat terrain.
If there is high terrain along the route, you may have to climb
significantly to get a map. Study the surrounding terrain and look for
Mapping opportunities when you can achieve LOS with minimum
exposure. If you can find such “windows of opportunity,” mark them on

AGR-3 C-2


Text from AGR-3_Modes_Controls_and_Displays_page_60.jpeg:
Graze angle has a great deal of impact on the quality of the HRM picture.
Higher graze angles result in very sharp contrast between “show” and
“no-show” areas. Bomb circles, runways and roads usually show clearly.
At lower graze angles, these features start to blend in with the
surrounding terrain. Cultural returns with vertical development, such as
buildings, stand out well at low graze angles. However, map quality is
reduced at low graze angles (low look-down angles). The actual graze
angle you achieve depends on the terrain, but you can make a “flat earth”
estimate using the 1:60 rule (Table D-2). For example, at 1000 feet and
10 nm an approximate 1° graze angle can be achieved. Good quality maps
can be achieved at a 1° graze angle and with good planning, useful maps
can be made from as little as .5° graze angle, i.e., 500 feet and 10 nm.
Thus as the graze angle decreases, selection of aim points and offsets
becomes increasingly important.

As a general guideline for planning, aim and offset points should be within
10 nm of course, 30-50° off the nose, not obscured by intervening terrain,
and have physical characteristics as mentioned earlier. Cluttered
environments, like rolling wooded hills, provide unique problems different
from those faced when map planning in desert terrain. For example, the
presence of 50-80 foot trees around the desired offset or aim point make
target acquisition more difficult than if they were not present. Since these
obstacles increase the altitude required to map the intended point, a new
point may have to be selected.

Keep in mind that a MN PVU should be performed prior to commanding a
patch map. Therefore, an additional 15-20 seconds or approximately

2-3 nm is added to the equation of when to begin the PVU/patch map
sequence. After TCTO 1F-15E-737, if the EGI is the PPKS, PVUs are not
required prior to map construction.

In-Flight Operation

Since the same radar provides A/A and A/G capability, you must time
share the system between modes. Most of the time, the radar is devoted
to A/A search. By monitoring route symbols on the TSD and radar, you
can estimate when the next aim point is approaching the HRM “sweet
spot.” Before mapping, however, accomplish a MN PVU, if it has been
more than 5 minutes since the last one.

Scroll to A/G radar, take command and select PVU mode. After accepting
the update, return to RBM and check the RBM display to ensure there are
radar returns under the appropriate symbol. This ensures you have LOS
to the point. Command the map, freeze the first acceptable patch map,
command additional maps, as required, and update/target as required,
and then go back to A/A search.

Radar updates are normally performed only for the MN, unless the INS
has excessive drift. If possible, update the MN approaching the target
area. This positions symbology more accurately on the radar display and
aids you in finding the target or offset. After TCTO 1F-15E-737, if the
EGI is the PPKS, sequence point symbols will be placed by the EGI.
Radar position updates should not be necessary with the EGI selected as
the PPKS.

A/G RADAR CONTROLS, DISPLAYS AND SYMBOLOGY

The operating modes of the APG-70 radar were explained in AGR-2. This
lesson deals with the general symbology, radar controls and procedures
and limitations. This section covers those cockpit controls (except
HOTAS) that are required to operate the radar in each of the modes.
HOTAS controls are covered in the next section.

Sensor Control Panel

The radar control knob located on the sensor control panel (Figure D-1)
has the following functions:

OFF Removes power from the radar.

STBY Initiates a 3 minute warm-up period. All the radar functions
are fully operational except the transmitter.

ON Applies power to the radar and transmitter with
weight-off-wheels. Also initiates a 3 minute warm-up if moved
directly from OFF to ON.

EMERG Overrides all protective interlocks except weight-on-wheels
(WOW) and transmitter coolant flow to provide a “must operate
at any cost” capability. A 3-minute warm-up is still required.
The power knob must be pulled up to select EMERG.

Multipurpose Display (MPD)

The air-to-ground radar display is selected from the Menu 1 display on
any MPD by pressing PB #14 (Figure D-2). The A/G RDR format cannot
be selected on the MPCDs; therefore, A/G RDR is not provided as an
option on Menu 1 on the MPCDs.

Text from AGR-3_Modes_Controls_and_Displays_page_9.jpeg:
Symbology

The following symbology is used for all modes (Figure D-3 through Figure
D-8):

A Antenna elevation scale - used to determine radar antenna
elevation in degrees. Scale is marked 0 (level), +1°, +2°, +5° and
+10° elevation.

B_ Pitch ball - displayed to indicate aircraft pitch angle with respect
to the horizon. The pitch ball is a circle if the INS is providing
attitude data over the radar high speed data bus (HSDB). If the
AHRS provides the attitude data, the pitch ball changes to a
small rectangle. If both the INS and AHRS stop communicating
on the radar HSDB, the pitch ball changes to an X.

After TCTO 1F-15E-737, the pitch ball is a circle if the INS is
providing the attitude data over the radar HSBD. If the INS
stops communicating on the radar HSDB, the embedded
GPS/INS (EGI) provides attitude data and the pitch ball changes
to a diamond. If both the INS and EGI stop communicating on
the radar HSDB, the pitch ball changes to an X.

C Antenna elevation caret - indicates present antenna elevation
with respect to the horizon or with respect to the pitch ball.
Maximum movement is +60° on the antenna elevation scale.

D Antenna azimuth scan scale - used to indicate antenna position
and is marked 0 and +60°. The zero azimuth mark is referenced
to the aircraft velocity vector (ground track).
