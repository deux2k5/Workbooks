Paveway II weapons (Figure D-2) have a tail assembly, which contains
four folding wings, each with a deployment spring. The wings are linked
to a mechanism that ensures simultaneous movement. Wing deployment
is activated at release by an external lanyard connected to the aft positive
arm attachment. Upon release, shock absorbers restrict wing deployment
until safe aircraft separation.

FMU-139A/B or the FMU-152/B. Only the FMU-152/B can be used for
GBU-10 with the MXU-651/B airfoil group (GBU-10 G/B, H/B, J/B)

Flight Path Characteristics

The flight path of the LGB is adjusted by the guidance and control section
to meet the required impact criteria. However, the design of the system
may result in some effects that can significantly degrade the performance
of the weapon. The following explanation of the typical LGB flight path
discusses these effects on performance.

The LGB flight path can be divided into three phases: ballistic, transition
and terminal guidance. The ballistic (unguided) phase, consists of the
period of flight which lasts at least as long as the gas grain generator
delay. The ballistic phase may last the entire time of flight (TOF),
depending on the field of view (FOV) and/or detector sensitivity
constraints that restrict target acquisition and guided response.

Ballistic Phase

During the ballistic phase, the weapon continues on the unguided
trajectory established by the flight path of the delivery aircraft at the
moment of release. In the ballistic phase, the delivery attitude takes on
additional importance. If released in a loft, the weapon continues its
climb, increasing in altitude but losing velocity. For level release, the
weapon begins to lose velocity almost immediately and continues to
decelerate until it has established a steep dive angle. Altitude permitting,
it now ceases to lose velocity and slowly accelerates. If released in a high
angle dive mode, the weapon normally accelerates from the moment of
release to impact or until it reaches terminal velocity.

The change in weapon velocity during the ballistic flight can be critical.
This is especially true if the velocity loss before acquisition is substantial.
The maneuverability of the LGB is related to the weapon velocity during
terminal guidance. Therefore, airspeed lost during the ballistic phase
(and not recovered before acquisition) equates to a proportional loss of
maneuverability during terminal guidance.

D-5 AGW-3


Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_12.jpeg:
Transition Phase

The transition phase begins at acquisition. The following conditions must
be satisfied to accomplish acquisition:

1. The target must be within the detector FOV.

2. The reflected laser energy from the target must be of sufficient
intensity to activate and maintain guidance circuits.

3. The gas grain generator delay must have expired and there must be
sufficient gas pressure buildup to activate the canards.

At acquisition, there is usually a large error between the weapon velocity
vector and the line of sight (LOS) to the target (Figure D-3). In the
transition phase, the weapon attempts to reduce this error by aligning the
velocity vector with the LOS vector to the target. This phase usually
takes from 0 to 3 seconds. During this period, the commands to the
control surfaces are generally sustained for longer periods, causing
additional energy loss.

Additionally as shown in Figure D-8, the first guidance command is
usually down for a weapon delivered near the ballistic trajectory to the
target. This causes the impact angle to be lower if the weapon guides to
the target than if it remains ballistic. Also if the weapon stops guiding
(failure of weapon or designator) it will normally resume a ballistic
trajectory to an impact short of the target.

Terminal Guidance Phase

The terminal guidance phase begins when the apparent guidance error is
reduced and the weapon develops an oscillating pattern around the LOS.
An oscillatory flight path is produced because (1) the detector senses only
the direction (not magnitude) of error, and (2) the canard deflections are
always full scale.

During terminal guidance, the LGB attempts to keep its velocity vector
aligned with the instantaneous LOS (Figure D-3). At the instant
alignment occurs, the reflected laser energy centers on the detector and
commands the canards to a trail position. At this time the weapon flies
ballistically with gravity biasing the velocity vector short of the target.
Therefore, the reflected energy is moved from the detector center, which
generates an up command. In effect, the weapon’s velocity vector tends to
oscillate about a point short of the target, which may cause the LGB flight
path to sag. The extent of this sag is dependent on the delivery angle and
airspeed.

Optimum Guidance Time

Release tables for LGBs are generated with consideration for the gas grain
generator safe separation delay, and provide for 5 seconds of guidance.
However, field experience has shown that an optimum guidance time of

8 seconds provides a much greater probability of success for low altitude
deliveries. The minimum TOF to ensure optimum guidance time for low
altitude deliveries are:

Paveway I (all) .......ccccccccccccccccceceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees 11 seconds
Paveway TD eecceccecceccccccccccccceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees 10 seconds
Codin

Laser coding has two purposes: (1) to meet the requirement for
bomb/target discrimination in a multilaser environment and (2) to provide
effective operation in the presence of enemy countermeasures. Asa
result, two code formats have been developed for use: pulse repetition
frequency (PRF) and pulse interval modulation (PIM). Refer to

TO 1-1M-34-1 (Confidential) for a detailed discussion of laser coding.

Delivery Considerations

LGBs are terminally guided munitions, not wonder bombs that can be
hurled into the general vicinity of the target and be expected to find, guide
to and impact the target.

Predicted LGB performance is based on the weapon release at a
preplanned airspeed, dive angle, altitude and horizontal ground range
from the target. The different LGB flight characteristics can dramatically
affect predicted performance. To improve LGB performance, those
characteristics can be controlled to some extent during the three phases of
LGB flight.

AGW-3 D-8


Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_15.jpeg:
Energy

Energy, a function of airspeed and altitude, is the prime consideration
when selecting the delivery parameters. Energy provides the
maneuverability necessary for the LGB to reach the target. Flight path
angle and airspeed are the primary parameters the aircrew can vary to
meet energy requirements. In general, a steeper flight path angle and
higher airspeed improve LGB performance.

Flight Path Angle

A flight path angle of approximately -30° is the general dividing line
between associated velocity effects. When the flight path angle is
shallower than -30°, the weapon continues to decelerate after acquisition
and until impact. This deceleration reduces the airspeed and thus the
maneuverability of the weapon. With the loss of maneuverability, the
control commands must be held longer to return the weapon to the line of
sight (LOS). The longer the command is held the more the airspeed is
depleted during the maneuver. When flight path angles become
shallower, the probability increases for a weapon to impact short of the
target. Weapons with a flight path angle steeper beyond -30° tend to
accelerate after acquisition. The steeper the angle above -30°, the greater
the acceleration. This results in increased maneuverability during the
final portion of flight, especially for dive angles of -45° or steeper (Figure
D-4).

Atmospheric Density Altitude Effects

The LGB flies like a glider, relying on energy for maneuverability. Like a
glider, the performance of the weapon is directly proportional to the total
energy possessed at release: potential and kinetic. The kinetic energy
level of the weapon is dynamic and is continually in a state of change: loss,
gain or conversion.

The G-producing capability of the LGB is directly related to the weapon’s
calibrated airspeed. Ballistic range depends on true airspeed. In
situations where the target may be located at a high density altitude, the
difference between true and calibrated airspeed becomes an important
planning factor. Under these conditions the LGB performance may be
degraded and it may be unable to generate sufficient maneuverability to
reach the target. In these cases, increasing true airspeed as much as
practical will compensate for the loss in maneuverability.

AGW-3 D-10


Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_17.jpeg:
Podium Effect

The podium effect (Figure D-5) must be countered when lasing a vertical
target. As the airborne designator flies around the target, it may become
impossible to illuminate the front of the target. Although the laser may
still be on the side of the target, the bomb may not have a clear LOS to the
laser spot. Once the LGB loses the spot from its FOV, it continues its
flight ballistically. This usually results in weapon impact short of the
target. Podium effect may be overcome by your wingman lasing for you
from behind or attacking from an angle to keep your pod LOS on the
target face; however, impact angle less than 90° may affect penetration.

Figure D - 5. Podium Effect.

Every designator has inherent stabilization characteristics that cause spot
motion while lasing a target. Even with automatic tracking or “perfect”
manual tracking, airborne designators have some spot motion due to
aircraft vibration. The amount of spot motion is variable and cannot be
minimized consistently for a long period of time. Spot motion tends to
increase the circular error probable (CEP) of the weapon due to increased
energy loss during the last few seconds of flight. Elevated spot, delayed
lasing and carefully chosen release parameters increase terminal energy

and help counter the adverse effects of spot motion for low altitude
deliveries. A good PTRK is also better than ATRK in reducing jitter.

There is also a laser-to-FLIR boresight tolerance of .25 mils and a laser
beam divergence of .25 mils. To ensure these factors do not pull the spot
off the target, be sure the target size (1 mil) is twice the diameter of the
crosshair gap in NFOV (.498 mils) during LGB guidance (Figure D-6).

AGW-03-06

Figure D - 6. Spot Motion.
Spot Height

Elevating the laser spot on a vertically developed target improves LGB
performance at low altitude when the shallow flight path angle is most
apparent.

Consider the situation when an LGB is committed against a small point
target from a low-altitude delivery. If all the preplanned release
parameters are met and the weapon acquires the target at the expected
slant range, the flight path angle during the guidance phase is usually
-30°, but angles of -10° to -15° are not uncommon. At these shallow flight
path angles, the influence of gravity is more pronounced than at angles
steeper than -45°. During oscillatory flight, the weapon is located below
instantaneous LOS for a larger portion of the time. As the flight
continues, and the weapon corrects up to the LOS, drag resulting from
control fin deflection increases and the airspeed decays. As the airspeed
decreases, the time required to make the correction back to the LOS
increases, as does the airspeed bleed off, and these effects continue until
weapon impact.

Delayed Lasing

During LGB development, the main delivery method for ballistic weapons
was high angle, high speed from medium-to-high altitude. These release
conditions conserved the weapon velocity and in many cases, under the
influence of gravity, the weapon accelerated and impacted at a velocity
higher than release. Under these employment conditions, target
acquisition as early as possible was beneficial and late acquisition could
prove disastrous. Taking these release parameters into consideration, the
guidance unit was designed to meet specific miss criteria under these
release conditions.

As threat capabilities improved, the proposed methods for employing the
LGB progressed from high speed, high angle to low altitude, low angle.

The change to the low-altitude employment environment increased the
importance of some LGB flight parameters. For instance, with a
high-angle, high-speed delivery, early lasing and acquisition was possibly
an advantage, but certainly not a disadvantage. In the low-altitude,
low-angle environment this was not true; too early an acquisition was a
hindrance.

With regard to guidance time, there are three possibilities: insufficient,
optimum and excessive. As implied, insufficient guidance time does not
allow the weapon adequate time to acquire the target, remove positional
errors and stabilize itself about the LOS before impact. Analysis of results
from flights with less than 6 seconds of guidance time has indicated they
are usually marginally satisfactory.

AGW-3 D-14


Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_21.jpeg:
During low-angle deliveries, with terminal flight path angles shallower
than -30°, extended or excessive guidance time produces a detrimental
effect on LGB performance. This is usually the result of excessive
airspeed loss. The weapon acquires, maneuvers to establish itself on the
instantaneous LOS, and (when on the LOS) commands control fins to go
in-trail. The weapon falls ballistically until an error is sensed by the
computer. At that time another control fin movement is commanded and
held until the weapon has returned to the LOS; the control fins then move
to the in-trail position. The process is repeated over and over until
weapon impact. During these periods when the control fins are at
maximum deflection, the increased drag results in an airspeed decay. As
the process is repeated, the LGB airspeed continues to decrease; and if the
guidance time is excessive, weapon maneuverability before impact may
have degenerated to the point of being insufficient to remove final
remaining errors. Performance degradation has been observed in
weapons with shallow impact angles and guidance time greater than

12 seconds.

From the boundaries presented for insufficient and excessive guidance
times (6 seconds and 12 seconds, respectively), it would appear that the
best result for low-altitude employment of LGBs can be achieved by
attempting to provide 8 to 10 seconds of guidance time to the weapon
under these conditions.

Loft deliveries, especially those released at less than +25°, fit into the
category of low-angle deliveries previously discussed. Loft deliveries
present their own set of unique characteristics that influence the manner
in which the LGB responds during guided flight.

The weapon velocity, representing the maneuvering capability available
for guided flight, may go through radical changes during the loft flight
profile. The airspeed deviation from release to apogee can vary as little as
a 12 knot loss for a +5° loft with 450 KTAS run-in to a loss of 253 knots for
a +40° loft with a 700 KTAS run-in. The loss of airspeed equates to
reduced maneuvering capability of the weapon during the terminal phase
of flight before impact.

Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_22.jpeg:
Figure D-8 shows a typical LGB loft guidance profile. From release at
point A, the weapon follows a ballistic trajectory, losing airspeed in the
climb. At point B the guidance electronics are activated to look for laser
energy within the seeker FOV. At point C the laser spot comes within the
FOV and the weapon begins terminal guidance. Note that the first
guidance command is down and the weapon attempts to stay on the LOS;
it is below the ballistic flight path to the target. This means that any loss
of guidance will result in the weapon resuming a new ballistic flight path
that will impact short of the target.

Some adverse effects can be mitigated by using the technique of delaying
target illumination (delayed lasing) that has the effect of conserving
weapon energy by delaying target acquisition and reducing weapon
guidance time.

Lofts of +1° to +10°, because of their short times of flight (normally less
than 12 seconds), do not lend themselves readily to the delayed lasing
technique. The maximum benefit from delayed lasing can be derived from
lofts with release angles greater than +10° and up to approximately +25°.
The primary reason is that LGBs lofted within this band may acquire the
target and initiate guidance before reaching apogee and therefore,
generate the problems associated with early acquisition and excessive
guidance times. Lofts at angles greater than +25° do not usually acquire
the target until past apogee, but these deliveries are compatible with the
technique of delayed lasing and benefits associated with its use. When
employing delayed lasing, plan to designate the target during the last 8 to
10 seconds of the weapon TOF.

AGW-3 D-16


Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_23.jpeg:
Figure D-9 shows the effects of delayed lasing on a 20°, 550 KTAS loft
delivery. If the weapon initiates guidance at position 1 as the laser spot
comes into the weapon FOV, it will not have the energy available to reach
the target and will impact short. If lasing is delayed until position 2, a
steeper impact angle will result. This is a risky technique however,
because if guidance is delayed too long, the weapon may not have time to
correct the trajectory to the target.

Optimal Release Point

LGB capabilities are expressed in terms of release envelopes. The release
envelope for a particular LGB is defined as that region in space where the
weapon can be released and achieve a 30 foot CEP. This means that for
given parameters within the envelope, a single LGB has a 50% probability
of guiding to within 30 feet of the target.

Figure D-10 shows a typical dive release envelope. These envelopes are
produced by a computer model using many ballistic and aerodynamic
inputs. FOV boundary limits show the capability of the weapon to acquire
the laser spot. Within the FOV limit is that envelope where release will
ensure a 30 foot CEP. In general, the front of the envelope is a FOV limit
and the rear is a weapon energy limit. Within the 30 foot CEP boundary
are two points of interest: the ballistic release point (BRP) and the optimal
release point (ORP).

Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_25.jpeg:
The BRP is the no-wind point where, if the weapon is released, the bomb
will ballistically hit the target. The ORP is the release point that provides
the highest probability of success for given parameters.

Valid arguments exist for using both these release points for weapon
delivery. The BRP gives good probability of target damage if the
designator or weapon guidance system fails. The drawback to using the
BRP is that it always lies near the forward edge of the envelope for higher
angle deliveries where release errors may put the weapon FOV beyond the
target. This would cause a no-guide and a bomb that hits long of the
target. For lower angle deliveries, the BRP lies further back in the
envelope where release errors may put the weapons too short to achieve a
30 foot CEP.

The ORP location takes into account both delivery errors and LGB
performance characteristics. Every dive release envelope is characterized
by dive angle, airspeed and delivery dispersion. A cross-sectioned cut in
the upper left corner (Figure D-10) illustrates how the LGB 30 foot CEP
boundary and aircraft delivery dispersion overlay are used to determine
the ORP. A release at the BRP or 30 foot CEP rear boundary would often
yield a release outside the 30 foot CEP due to delivery errors. Delivery at
the ORP yields a release inside the 30 foot CEP.

dispersion. An LGB release between the front and rear FOV boundaries

LGBs released outside the envelope, but within the FOV, will acquire the

LGBs released outside the FOV boundaries will not acquire the target and
will fall ballistically. LGBs released on the ORP will acquire and guide to
the target with the highest probability of success.

AGW-3 D - 20


Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_27.jpeg:
The F-15E central computer is programmed to deliver LGBs at the BRP.
Track correction is required to adjust for release at the ORP. Figure D-10
shows that for long range (high angle) lofts, the ORP is before the BRP.
This requires a negative track correction for release at the ORP, which
would cause the bomb to ballistically fall short if guidance fails. For short
range (low angle) lofts the ORP is long of the BRP. This would require a
positive track correction, which would cause the bomb to ballistically fall
long of the target. Note that at low angles, the ballistic line falls outside
the 30 foot CEP envelope. This means that with no track correction, a low
angle loft delivery may not achieve a 30 foot CEP even if it guides. Also
note there is one point at which the BRP and the ORP are the same. Loft
deliveries at this release point will ballistically hit the target if they do not
guide. They will also have the highest probability of hit if they do guide.

There are many employment techniques involving the use of the ORP.
ORP was first developed before delayed lasing techniques and is now not
considered to be as critical to success. A lot will depend on the advice and
experience of your squadron weapons officer and others that have
employed GBUs using both ORP and BRP.

Summary Considerations

e Delivery parameters must be selected that yield a minimum TOF of
10 to 11 seconds

e Delay lasing until the last 8 to 10 seconds of TOF for low angle
deliveries. Continuous lasing is recommended for GBU-10s released

above 20,000 feet

e Steeper flight path angle and higher airspeed improve LGB
performance

e Ensure laser energy stays on the same side of a vertical target from
which the weapon was delivered

e Keep spot motion to a minimum
e Elevate the laser spot on vertical targets for low angle deliveries

e Consider ORP techniques

Next choose a delivery profile based on the threat, the above factors and
the weather, to include:

e Laser range depends on humidity, dust, etc.
e With low ceilings take care not to loft the bomb into clouds

e Rain showers may also affect the bomb before delivery. Paveway IIs
have a rain impact endurance of ten minutes before the seeker
degrades.

e Wind effects are discussed in the employment considerations section.
Employment Considerations

Elevating the laser spot has already been addressed. Laser guided
ordnance is also affected by wind from release to impact. During the
unguided portion of its trajectory, the LGB travels with the air mass
exactly the same as an unguided bomb. Once guidance is initiated, the
wind affects the weapon in much the same manner as gravity. A
crosswind will cause the weapon to fly a homing flight path to the target.
A headwind increases LGB tendency to hit short, or downwind. The loss
of energy and homing effect are results of the increased number of up
commands necessary to maintain the LOS.

The spot designation should correct for winds during the guidance phase.
The winds from the surface to 4000 feet are more significant than those
above 4000 feet. So wind correction should be based on the average winds
of these altitudes. The illuminator may compensate for wind by offsetting
the spot on the target into the wind 1 foot per knot (not to exceed 20 feet
and never move the spot off the target). Tail wind corrections are not
necessary as it reduces the range and flight time of the weapon except
when tail wind exceeds 20 knots and the FOV becomes a problem. Tail
wind counteracts the LGB tendency to hit short by getting the bombs to
the target with less energy expenditure. However, spot positioning for
wind should take second place to other considerations, such as elevated
spot. The tendency is to overcorrect for wind, and 20 feet is a pretty small
distance (consider target size).

D-25 AGW-3


Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_32.jpeg:
Target considerations include target study, axis of attack and target
reflectivity. Satellite photographs from the AFMSS or other sources
provide excellent target study information. As always, working big to
small is most effective. The axis of attack may be dictated by ground
based laser teams, the threat, friendly troop positions or the wish to take
advantage of environmental elements. Optimizing sun shadow for the
target pod, maximizing vertical development and minimizing wind effects
all may lead to a specific attack axis or designation turn off left or right.
In most cases, especially low altitude, a designation leg with the targeting
pod looking left is desired rather than looking right through the aircraft
(i.e. aircraft checks right after release).

Employment Profile

You may be given the opportunity to drop inert or live LGBs while at
FTU. A typical high altitude, low threat profile is shown in Figure D-13.
The pilot flies the profile and maintains visual on lead or deconflicts with
the A/A radar after 12 nm. The WSO performs a PVU prior to 20 nm.
After checking 30°, mapping, updating and designating (.67 DW) are
accomplished. No later than 12 nm, the pilot must proceed direct to the
target (center ASL). The WSO then acquires the target with the targeting
pod, tracks the target (ATRK recommended), and fires the laser for a
designation. Valid laser ranging occurs when LAS XXXXX is at the top
left corner of the targeting pod.

Figure D - 18. GBU High Altitude Threat.

The example given is for a 25° dive. Another delivery option is a level
delivery.

After bomb release, a 60-90° check off target will maintain the
designation. Masking occurs according to the target pod limits. Flashing
cursors indicate approaching a mask condition. Lifting the target side
wing and a slight bunt (low altitude) should delay the masking long
enough for bomb impact. Time to impact (TIMPCT.XX) is displayed at the
top center of the target pod display under PB #18 as well as on the HUD.
A rule of thumb is if TIMPCT is at 15 seconds or less when the target
reaches 3/9 (usually about 50-60° of turn) on the pod, masking will not
occur.

PAVEWAY III
Low-level, Laser Guided Bomb (GBU-24)

The GBU-24 low-level, laser guided bomb (LLLGB) comprises a

2000 pound bomb body, suitable fuzing and guidance kit. The guidance
kit consists of two main sections: a guidance control unit (GCU) and an
AFG. The GCU consists of a laser energy detector (seeker assembly), a
guidance electronics unit (GEU) and a bomb control section. PW III uses
helium gas for canard movement. The AFG consists of a folding-wing
assembly, four canard-type guidance fins, a forward adapter assembly and
other ancillary items for mounting hardware.

Two versions of the GBU-24 are available. The GBU-24/B (Figure D-14)
uses a standard MK-84 bomb body, while the GBU-24A/B uses a BLU-109
bomb body to increase effectiveness against hardened targets. Fuzing
options include any of those that are compatible with the MK-84 or
BLU-109 warheads.

Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_38.jpeg:
The BSU-84/B AFG provides properly sized wings and control fins for the
MK-84 warhead. Additional adapters are used with the BLU-109
warhead. The folding-fin wing assembly is mounted on the tail of the
warhead. The fins are deployed by internal springs immediately after
bomb release. Fins are off center to roll the bomb.

Performance envelopes for all modes of delivery are considerably larger
than those for earlier LGBs due to increased maneuverability (larger
wings), proportional guidance (not bang-bang) and increased seeker
sensitivity and field of regard.

Fuzing

The GBU-24/B can use the FMU-81/B, FMU-139A/B or the FMU-152/B
fuzes. The GBU-24A/B can use the FMU-1438 series or FMU-152/B fuzes.

Initialization

At pickle, the bomb is unlocked from its rack and the ejector feet push it
away. The fuze arming wires are withdrawn, activating one or both fuzes,
as determined by cockpit arming selection. The thermal battery lanyard
is tied off to the rear bomb lug and a swivel connects the lanyard to the
nose arming solenoid. This allows the weapon to be jettisoned without
activating the autopilot, which could fly the weapon excessive distances
before impact.

The tail latch is activated by approximately 50 pounds of tension from a
lanyard that is tied off to the positive arming attachment. This lanyard
has a weak link that breaks when about 220 pounds of tension is applied,
allowing the lanyard to fall away with the weapon.

Major initialization events are as follows:

1.

The two lanyards are pulled approximately 0.1 second after pickle.
The rear lanyard activates the wing deployment sequence only.

The next event in the time sequence is a ballistic mode test at 1.2
seconds. If altitude, as indicated by the barometer, is greater than
15,000 feet, the ballistic mode is entered after bump-up.

In the example, the safe escape timeout is shown at 2.0 seconds. The
software timer starts at microprocessor-up and runs for 1.3 seconds
to ensure at least 1.5 seconds from lanyard pull, to canard activation.
Before this time, the canards are in free trail. When the control fins
are activated, a positive (up) vertical command is issued. This starts
the initial velocity estimate sequence and provides an early pull-up
or bump-up that may be critical if the release altitude is low.

The initial bump-up command excites the airframe and causes a
short series of pitch oscillations. The frequency of these oscillations
is air-speed dependent, and measurement of the frequency of the
oscillations provides a measure of airspeed. The airspeed estimate is
used for nearly all decisions and calculations made by the
microprocessor. This initial velocity estimate is updated
continuously throughout weapon flight.

The seeker is uncaged at 2.2 seconds and the gimbal torquers are
energized at 2.3 seconds. If, at this time, the target return is within
the seeker's instantaneous field of view (IFOV), such as when
working close to the target, the seeker will slew to center the target.
This feature allows direct transition to terminal guidance at

4 seconds.

AGW-3 D - 34


Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_41.jpeg:
6. After 4 seconds have elapsed, the delivery mode decision can be
made. The length of time required for this decision is complicated by
several factors, and the time line reflects worst-case conditions.
Therefore, the delivery mode decision to follow a loft, level or dive
midcourse can occur between 4 and 13 seconds. Pressure altitude
changes, between successive altitude measurements, are used to
determine if the weapon is climbing, diving or nearly level. If the
initial velocity estimate is above 900 fps, a delay of up to 10 seconds
allows the weapon to slow down. If the airspeed drops below 900 fps
prior to 10 seconds, the altitude measurements begin and an earlier
decision is made. The altitude and velocity differentials are
triangulated to determine the climb or dive angle. This angle
computation determines the midcourse mode to be entered.

The decision zones for midcourse selection are:
@ Level or altitude-hold mode: -10° to +15° FPA
@ Loft mode: above +15° FPA
@ Dive or constant glide slope mode: below -10° FPA

Because of measurement inaccuracies, an improper mode decision may
occur when the weapon is released near the -10° or +15° decision
boundaries. This zone of improper mode selection is several degrees wide,
and its variance about the decision boundary changes with Mach. This
improper mode selection has minimal consequences.

In the loft case, an improper decision places the weapon in the
altitude-hold mode. Because the range capability in altitude-hold is
generally greater than the loft capability, the weapon reaches the target
unless the desire was to loft over a range of hills. Therefore, when lofting
to clear intervening terrain, a minimum loft angle of 20° should be used.

Figure D - 17. Delivery Above 15,000 Feet.

At a maximum time of 1.2 seconds after release, the computer reads the
altimeter. If the altitude is above 15,000 feet mean sea level (MSL), the
canards are driven to the 0° deflection position after safe separation and
bump-up. The weapon then falls ballistically until acquisition. After
acquisition, terminal guidance is initiated and a g-biased proportional
guidance trajectory is established. This trajectory shaping generally adds
5° to 10° of impact angle to the weapon acquisition angle. Impact angles
from 25° to 65° can be achieved. Planning considerations for this type of
delivery are virtually the same as those for the Paveway I and Paveway II
systems. Other considerations are:

1. Dive bomb deliveries above 15,000 feet may require a depressed

pipper because the weapon falls ballistically and not in the constant
glide-path mode available below 15,000 feet.

D - 37 AGW-3


Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_44.jpeg:
2. Because the weapon has excess energy from releases above
15,000 feet, true centroid releases from the center of the envelope are
possible. This type of release does not degrade weapon accuracy as it
did in earlier LGBs because the seeker sensitivity is greater.

This equates to, “when in doubt, release early, not late.” In dive
deliveries, do not press the front edge of the envelope expecting greater
accuracy as in the Paveway I and Paveway II.

Deliveries below 15,000 feet have an adaptive midcourse based on delivery
attitude.

Level Delivery Below 15,000 Feet

Level delivery of the LLLGB is possible down to normal level safe escape
altitude of about 500 feet AGL. After release, the weapon climbs
approximately 450 feet (bump-up) and then levels off (Figure D-18). After
level-off, the weapon holds a straight-and-level midcourse until target
acquisition occurs. After the acquisition, the terminal mode is entered
where trajectory shaping (G-bias) occurs to achieve a good impact angle.
In addition, proportional navigation guidance is initiated to cancel wind
and target motion effects.

The level or altitude hold mode is entered after the bump-up maneuver is
completed and flight path angle lies between -10° and +15°. To ensure not
exceeding the level profile limits, the F-15E will not release a bomb in
AUTO mode outside of +10° to -5° with a loft angle of 0° set in the A/G
delivery program page.

AGW-3 D - 38


Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_45.jpeg:
During altitude hold, the seeker +30° azimuth bar scan pattern is
approximately 10° below the inertially sensed horizon. The
straight-and-level midcourse is flown until target acquisition, at which
time a transition is made to the terminal mode.

The terminal mode causes the weapon to climb slightly and then nose over
toward the target. The impact angle from level flight is generally 25° and
is always at least 10° if the weapon is released within the envelope.

Level Safe Escape

A miniloft delivery (2° to 12° of pitch) is required for releases below the
weapon safe escape altitude. This slight pitch up ensures safe escape
since the weapon is bumping to a level flight profile and also may fall
away ballistically and hit the ground prior to its bump. For safe escape, a
4 G turn must be used after release for 500 feet level and miniloft
deliveries. This type of weapon delivery is sensed as a level delivery if
release is below the +15° boundary and the weapon will enter the
altitude-hold mode. Figure D-19 shows the required pitch angle for safe
escape when releasing below the level safe escape altitude (with a 4G
break). The example indicates the pitch angle required for safe escape
from a 100 foot AGL release at 500 KTAS. The MK-84 requires a 5°
minimum pitch angle.

Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_46.jpeg:
Employment of the LLLGB in the level or altitude-hold mode requires
adequate planning to use the full potential of the weapon. Major
considerations include weapon TOF, acquisition range and LOS
restrictions.

Dive Bomb Delivery Below 15,000 Feet

Dive bomb delivery was designed for the Mode 1 low profile, but can be
used in any mode. Dive bomb delivery of the LLLGB is more simplified
than the delivery of other conventional weapons when the LLLGB is
released below 15,000 feet. It is called a point and shoot delivery and is
delivered in DIRECT instead of AUTO. Remember in AUTO the bomb
will not release with lower than a -5° FPA. It is only necessary for the
crew to point the aircraft at the target and release the weapon (pickle).
The velocity vector within 25 mils of the target is the preferred pointing
method, but a pipper mil setting or the ZSL gun cross may also be used.
After release, the weapon bumps up and then acquires the aircraft dive
angle at release and flies a constant glide-path to the target (Figure D-20).

At acquisition, the terminal mode will bias the subsequent flight path
above the initial flight path to a degree dependent upon the mode
selection on the weapon and the time spent in the terminal mode. For
most deliveries, the resulting impact angle is 5° to 10° steeper than the

AGW-3 D - 40


Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_47.jpeg:
release angle and impact angles range from 25° to 65° for Mode 1 and 2 or
steeper for Modes 3 and 4. Because a dive profile will impact in the
vicinity of the target even if it does not guide, this delivery was used
extensively in Kosovo. A Mode 4 high diving profile has also been used in
Northern Watch and achieved in excess of 70° impact angles.

The base leg placement is not critical in most deliveries because dive angle
is not a factor when the airspeed is above 400 KTAS and the ground range
is less than 17,000 feet. These minimum parameters allow a dive angle
between 10° to 60° with no concern about the weapon having sufficient
energy to reach the target. As the release airspeed is increased, the
maximum ground range possible extends to well over 40,000 feet at 700
KTAS.

Loft Delivery (All Altitudes)

Loft deliveries with the LLLGB are compatible with standard loft delivery
techniques. When the weapon is lofted above 15°, the weapon's computer
senses the delivery method and zeroes the canards after the bump-up
maneuver. The weapon then flies a ballistic trajectory until acquisition
(Figure D-21). After acquisition, the weapon trajectory-shaping algorithm
produces a flight path that is flown above the acquisition LOS. This
prevents the trajectory sag and short-of-the-target impacts associated
with Paveway I and II. Impact angles of 55° to 65° are achieved.

Mode 2 Delivery

Delivery options in Mode 2 are identical to Mode 1 except performance is
improved against hard targets by limiting canard travel to 5° just prior to
impact. This reduces the weapon's angle of attack (AOA), improving
penetration characteristics. Mode selection is based on 10,000 feet versus
15,000 feet. The BLU-109 bomb body also increases penetration of hard
targets. Mode 2 is preferred over Mode 1 due to greater penetration and
greatly improved software coding. There is also a fast track profile in
Modes 1 and 2. If acquisition is made prior to completion of bump, G bias
starts immediately for steeper impact. Continuous lase is standard with
PW III since energy loss is not a factor as with PW II. If you do not want
fast track, delay lasing until initialization is complete. Fast track may
cause the bomb to enter clouds and lose track.

Mode 3 Delivery

This mode was designed to provide a low altitude delivery (below

8000 feet) against a horizontal or vertical hard target such as runways or
hardened command and control facilities (Figure D-22). This mode allows
the aircrew to deliver the weapon with ceilings as low as 2000 feet, if 500
foot AGL run-in altitude is used to deliver the weapon. At weapon
release, the bomb performs a bump-up maneuver of 1100 feet to
approximately 1600 feet AGL and enters an altitude-hold mode similar to
Mode 1. The guidance package enters into a box scan and searches for
laser energy. After acquisition, the weapon enters a gimbal angle hold
mode where the control system tries to establish and hold a 27° look-down
angle between the weapon centerline and seeker line of sight. Impact
angles of 35-40° are achieved against horizontal targets and 50-55°
against vertical targets.

Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_49.jpeg:
At longer acquisition ranges, the weapon may even climb to establish the
27° look down. As the weapon approaches the target, a point is reached
where its maneuver limit is met. At this point, the weapon pushes over to
center the seeker head, i.e., flies toward the target. Approximately

7.5 seconds later the canards are limited to 5° of deflection to reduce AOA
at impact. Impact angles of 35° to 40° can be achieved from a 500 foot
level delivery. If weather and defenses allow, much higher impact angles
against horizontal hard targets can be achieved by increasing the
weapon's release altitude.

A medium to high altitude delivery option was added to Mode 3 increasing
the weapons versatility (Figure D-23). In the medium to high altitude
arena, the weapon has the capability to destroy hardened vertical targets.
Above 8000 feet MSL, the weapon searches for laser energy with a box
scan. At acquisition, the weapon pushes over to enter a 17° terminal glide
all the way to the target. Canard limiting is also used in this mode to
decrease AOA just prior to impact.

It is better to release the weapon near the rear of the envelope in Modes 3

Mode 4 Delivery

This mode is very similar to Mode 3 with one major exception. After
release below 8000 feet, the weapon climbs 2500 feet above release
altitude and enters an altitude-hold mode to attack horizontal targets. An
additional requirement for this mode is a 3500 foot ceiling (Figure D-24).
Again, at acquisition the gimbal angle hold of 27° is initiated. Trajectory
shaping through the pushover maneuver and higher altitude result in
impact angles of 45° to 50° versus Mode 3 impact angles of only 35° to 40°.

A medium to high altitude delivery option was also incorporated into
Mode 4 adding another method for the weapon to penetrate horizontal
hardened targets. Like Mode 3, at weapon release above 8000 feet MSL,
the weapon enters a box scan and pushes over to 17°. Instead of
maintaining 17° through impact as in Mode 3, at acquisition the weapon
starts a trajectory shaping routine that may be level flight or even a slight
climb to maximize impact angle (55° to 60°, 70° max) (Figure D-25).

Delivery Profile Summary

The delivery options of the GBU-24 seem numerous and somewhat
confusing. To simplify the thought process a bit:

@ Mode 1 is used for soft targets with adaptive midcourse profiles based
on delivery parameters.

@ Mode 2 uses the same flight profiles as Mode 1, but the break altitude
is reduced to 10,000 feet and terminal guidance was added to limit
canard deflection and increases the weapon’s penetration.

@ Modes 3 and 4 are completely different level delivery modes adding
four additional trajectories for the GBU-24. The break altitude is now
8000 feet. One profile is for vertical targets, two are for horizontal
targets and one can be used for either vertical or horizontal targets.

@ See Section G for mode comparisons and quick reference summary
pullouts.

@ The MK-84 bomb body can be used in Modes 2 through 4 if the
BLU-109 is selected on the guidance unit (WGU-12B/B).

LLLGB Employment Considerations

GBU-24s have no backup ballistic delivery option. If the target is not
illuminated or the guidance system fails, the weapon will not impact the
target. Ifa backup ballistic capability is desired, consider using Paveway
I or II LGBs.

A GBU-24 may lose the laser spot because of laser turnoff, airframe
blanking or blockage caused by clouds or terrain. At acquisition loss the
seeker stares at the target for 2.5 seconds and if there is no reacquisition,
enters a lost acquisition routine. This attempts to maneuver the weapon
close to the target, but impact may not occur close enough for target
destruction.

GBU-24 performance envelopes have been developed for level, miniloft,
loft or dive deliveries. With GBU-24 on the aircraft, the mode must be
selected on the PACS load page and the A/G weapon delivery submenu
contains entries for desired ground range, time-to-lase and loft angle
(Figure D-27).

GBU-24s are loaded from page 5 on the PACS load page. GBU-24

(PB #14) is only for mode 1. GBU-24A (PB #13) allows MODE SELECT to
appear at PB #7 (after station loading), which cycles the mode under the
boxed, loaded stations (MS-1 to MS-4). The GBU-24s are then
programmed as usual on the PACS program page. CDIP is not an option.
Usually AUTO is selected on the PACS and DIRECT is optioned in the
front cockpit by taking command of the HUD (A/G master mode) and
going aft on the auto acq switch. This action changes AUTO to DIRECT
on the PACS page as well as on the HUD.

The A/G delivery page is then used to set the weapon parameters. Loft 0°
is used for all but loft deliveries. TARM is not an option at PB #6.

Desired ground range (DGR) is set at PB #7 and is the release range for
an AUTO delivery. In DIRECT the pickle button is hot and DGR is not
considered.

Lase time is usually continuous, but 12, 15 or 20 seconds are options.
Times are entered through the scratch pad; type “C” for continuous.
Release data for other lase times has not been calculated and cannot be
entered.

GBU-28A/B Hard Target Penetrator

The GBU-28A/B is a 4700 pound precision laser guided weapon intended
for use against fixed, high value, hardened, horizontal or near-horizontal
targets. The round consists of a penetration warhead with a guidance
unit and airfoil group attached. Major components of the item are shown
in Figure D-29 and are discussed below. Each Paveway weapon
configuration is marked with a color identification to match the major
components (guidance unit, wing assembly and canards) for that
configuration. The GBU-28A/B assigned color is white.

The GBU-28A/B may be configured with either the BLU-113/B or
BLU-113A/B warhead. The BLU-113/B is the designation for the initial
warhead constructed of Howitzer gun barrels welded to nose and aft
pieces. The BLU-113A/B is a later version produced from a one-piece
forging. The basic dimensions and mass properties of the two warheads
are identical, as are the guidance and aircraft interfaces.

Fuzing

For both warheads, fuzing is by a single, tail-mounted FMU-1438()/B fuze
system with selection of 30ms (F/B), 60ms (G/B) or 120ms (H/B) functional
delay. Fuze electrical power is provided by the FZU-32B/B initiator. Fuze
lanyards are packaged with the fuze system.

D-51 AGW-3


Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_58.jpeg:
Guidance and Control

The GCU contains a sensitive laser seeker, a GEU and a control section.
No electrical interface is required by the delivery aircraft. System power
is provided by a self-contained thermal battery that is lanyard activated
at the time of weapon release. Inertial reference is provided by a roll gyro
and pitch/yaw gyro activated at release. Fundamental guidance is
obtained by detection and generation of LOS error signals from the
reflected, pulsed laser energy applied to a selected target. The LOS error
signals are processed by the autopilot into guidance commands that, in
turn, drive the two-axis control canards. Power to the canards is provided
by pressurized gas. Target pressure altitude and laser coding are set on
the control unit (Figure D-30). Altitude options are from -2000 ft (A1) to
13,750 ft (H8) target pressure altitude in 250 ft increments. Altitude
selection is critical. When in doubt, use a lower estimate.

The GBU-28A/B weapon software, operational flight program (OFP),
guides the weapon to the laser spot by providing commands to control
weapon and seeker movement. The weapon transitions through four
distinct phases of flight: munition separation, midcourse, terminal
guidance and command limiting. Figure D-31 shows a graphical overview
of the weapon guidance and control from release to target impact.

AGW-3 C-2


Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_60.jpeg:
The munition separation phase is approximately 2 seconds long and
allows for the weapon to fall safely away from the release aircraft before
the weapon’s actuator becomes active. During munition separation, the
OFP will go through an initialization process, exercise the control actuator
valves, and begin estimation of flight parameters. Estimation of flight
parameters is performed by processing data provided by onboard sensors.
At the end of munition separation, the OFP will initiate firing of the gas
bottle squib to activate the weapon’s actuator. Although it can be
delivered from level flight or a loft profile, level flight is preferred. The
weapon should be launched as high and as fast as possible.

Midcourse is the phase of flight when the weapon is searching for the
target. The OFP generates commands to cause the seeker to look down
10°. The OFP generates a pull down command of 12° until the weapon
reaches a dive angle of 60° or acquires the target. The weapon transitions
from midcourse to terminal when the weapon acquires the target.

During terminal guidance, the OFP uses the LOS angles from the seeker
to estimate LOS rates. Guidance commands are generated using biased
proportional navigation.

At approximately 1 second before impact, the weapon transitions from

terminal guidance to AOA control. During AOA control, the guidance
commands are limited and rate damping is used to minimize impact AOA.

AGW-3 D- 54


Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_61.jpeg:
Rate damping is employed at various times throughout the flight to
minimize body angular rates. Rate damping is employed for 1 second as
the weapon transitions from munition separation to midcourse, for

1 second as the weapon transitions from midcourse to terminal, and for
the last 10 seconds of flight. Additionally, rate damping is employed
anytime the estimated body angular rates are larger than 75° per second.

The GBU-28A/B time line is shown in Table D-3.

Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_62.jpeg:
Hard Target Penetration

Target penetration is a function of the weapon’s velocity, impact angle and
AOA at impact. Impact angle is the angle between the weapon’s velocity
vector and the target plane. The best penetration is achieved when the
impact angle is 90°. AOA is the angle between the weapon’s velocity
vector and the longitudinal axis of the weapon. The best penetration is
achieved when the AOA is 0°.

The GBU-28A/B guidance algorithms are designed to maximize the
impact angle and minimize impact AOA. These are discussed further

below.

Impact Angle

Impact angle is maximized by:
@ Aircraft releasing the weapon from high altitude.
@ Weapon executing midcourse pull-down maneuver.

The steepest impact angles are achieved when the weapon is released
near the front edge of the release envelope.

Angle of Attack (AOA)

Impact AOA is minimized by:

@ Using LOS rate bias to put the weapon on the ballistic path to the
target.

@ Employing rate damping to minimize body angular rates.

@ Limiting guidance commands near impact.

The key to successful limiting guidance commands near impact is to
accurately estimate time to impact. If the guidance commands are limited
too early in the flight, the miss distance may be relatively large. If the

guidance commands are limited too late in flight then the AOA may be
relatively large.

AGW-3 D - 56


Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_63.jpeg:
Guidance Command Limiting

The GBU-28A/B weapon software has two time to impact estimators. The
primary time to impact estimator uses the weapon’s estimate of altitude
and vertical velocity to estimate time to impact. The secondary time to
impact estimator is based on the time in flight when the seeker switches
to low gain (normally within one second of impact). The seeker switches
to low gain when the reflected laser light saturates the seeker.

The primary estimator is a function of the weapon’s estimate of altitude
above the target and vertical velocity. The guidance command limits are
enabled when impact is less than 1 second. At high impact speeds, the
guidance commands are limited to 0°. At low impact speeds, the guidance
commands are limited to 2°. A 2° limit will result in a significantly
smaller miss distance than a 0° limit when the limits are applied early.

Since a 0° guidance command limit will yield better penetration than a
2° guidance command limit, a secondary estimator is employed based on
the time in flight when the seeker switches to low gain. The guidance
command limits are enabled whenever impact is less than 1 second and
the guidance command limits will be set to 0° regardless of impact speed.
This estimator is considered a secondary one because the seeker may not
switch to low gain if the target reflectivity is low and/or the visibility is
low.

Target altitude is critical for the above estimators to function properly.
When in doubt, use a lower estimate.

Optimum Release Points (ORP)

ORPs were developed to provide the best chance of weapon acquisition
and guidance to the target. The ORP is at a point in the envelope where:

@ Seeker acquisition range is near the minimum required for the given
release conditions.

@ There is sufficient margin between the point and envelope edges.
@ The impact angle is near the maximum, which will provide the best

penetration for the given release condition. Therefore, the ORP for an
inclined target is different than the ORP for a horizontal target.

D-57 AGW-3


Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_64.jpeg:
The ORP is determined by ballistic tables in TO 1-1M-34-1. The ORP is
adjusted for the head or tail component of wind at the release altitude and
entered as a desired ground range (DGR) on the A/G delivery page.

GBU-28A/B Summary

The GBU-28A/B was developed to penetrate hardened targets. It
currently has two delivery profiles, but is usually launched from level
flight as high and fast as practical.

The weapon profile is optimized for a 90° impact angle and zero AOA to
achieve maximum penetration. Software estimates of TOF, rate damping
and AOA control are used to control the profile. Setting the correct ORP
from the ballistic tables in the A/G delivery page and the correct pressure
altitude on the weapon control unit are critical to achieving a good profile.

Flight planning requirements and ballistic tables are provided in the
classified TO 1-1M-34-1.

TEXT
PAVEWAY I AND II (GBU-10/12)
Introduction

Laser-guided bombs (LGBs) are general purpose bomb bodies equipped
with electronic and mechanical assemblies that provide laser terminal

guidance. There is no electrical interface between the aircraft and any
LGB.

There are three categories of LGBs used by the USAF. Paveway I is an
early LGB with fixed wings. Paveway II LGBs are very similar but have
improved electronics, laser coding ability, increased aircraft carriage
(speed and Gs), wider field of view and better maneuverability. Paveway
III LGBs are vastly different and will be discussed separately.

Paveway II is desired for combat employment, but there are still plenty of
Paveway Is being used, especially for training. The F-15E PACS options
for the GBU-10 are Paveway II ballistics only. When dropping Paveway I
weapons, along track corrections must be applied.

Components

All LGB weapons consist of a computer control group (CCG), warhead
(bomb body and fuzes) and an airfoil group (AFG). A detailed description
of which components make up which LGB version is contained in

TO 1-1M-34.

Computer Control Group (CCG)

The CCG is composed of the seeker assembly, detector, computer and
control section, and guidance canards.

Seeker Assembly

The seeker assembly contains the detector assembly, optics and electronic
circuitry that determines the direction of the laser reflected energy and
generates appropriate error correction signals. The seeker, which is free
to move in pitch and yaw, is always streamlined into the relative wind by
a ringtailed stabilizer mounted around its circumference.

Detector

A four-quadrant, light-sensitive disk produces a very small electrical
signal when the laser spot hits it. Since the seeker is stabilized into the
relative wind, the location of the spot of light on the detector is determined
by the relative position of the target. For example, if the spot of light falls
in the upper right hand quadrant, the bomb electronics indicate the target
is down and left, relative to its present flight path. (The spot is in the
opposite quadrant due to reversal of position by the seeker lens.)

Computer and Control Section

The computer and control section process signals from the detector and
transmit directional command signals to the appropriate pair(s) of
canards. Circuitry in the computer contains the guidance logic, and in the
Paveway II, has laser coding capabilities.

A thermal battery is activated by an external lanyard when the bomb is
released. After a 2-3 second delay an electrical pulse fires the gas grain
generator. Gas from the generator is controlled through a manifold
assembly with four cylinders. A solenoid for each cylinder is controlled by
directional signals from the computer. Actuation of the solenoids permits
gas to enter the corresponding cylinder and move the pistons that are
mechanically connected to the canards.

Guidance Canards

Guidance canards are attached to each quadrant of the control unit to
change the flight path of the weapon. Opposing canards always respond
simultaneously (act in pairs) to generate up/down or left/right directional
changes. The deflections are always full scale (bang, bang guidance). The
bomb is not roll stabilized and may rotate randomly about its longitudinal
axis. The guidance computer is able to function and cope with the slow
roll rates generated.

Warhead

GBU-10 and GBU-12 LGBs can consist of any of three general purpose
bomb warheads. Each warhead contains any of the fuzes compatible with
that warhead. GBU-12s contain a standard 500 pound MK-82 bomb body.
GBU-10s can consist of either a standard 2000-pound MK-84 body or the
BLU-109/B penetrator bomb body.

Airfoil Group

The AFG consists of the adapter collar (which is bolted to the nose of the
bomb for installation of the CCG), the canards and the tail assembly. On
Paveway I weapons (Figure D-1), a fixed tail is bolted to the bomb and
extenders are bolted to the wing to form a long winged bomb (slow speed
configuration).
