NUCLEAR WEAPON LOADING

This section shows the many nuclear PACS display formats and explains
their pertinent legends.

For this example, assume you have a B61-4 on the left CFT and a B61-3
on the right CFT. There is no way to tell what is loaded by looking at the
initial display (Figure D-3).

NUC Weapon Load

To bring up the NUC WEAPON LOAD display, press PB #9 on the top
level armament display. This display shows the loaded stations across the
top. It also contains the compatible weapon legends as options for
identifying exactly which B-61 model is actually loaded. (Nuclear
weapons will self-identify on the PACS but may not be the correct model.)

Weapon Options

Once you have loaded the weapon by first boxing the appropriate legend
(in this case, B61-3, PB #8) and then pressing the proper station button
(#17 for the right CFT), the display looks like Figure D-4.

STA RC is displayed below the options indicating that the weapon on the
right CFT is selected for options programming. The selectable options for
the weapon are displayed adjacent to PBs #6-10 and PB #12. The options
shown are the default options and are selected in numerical PB order.
Repeated depressions of these push buttons step through the available
options. Loading of the weapon is complete when the options adjacent to
the option push buttons match those you wish to select. (A table of
options for each bomb is contained in TO 1F-15E-25-1.)

You can then exit to the menu or load other weapons.

PROGRAMMING

Pressing the A/G button on the ARMT menu brings up a display like
Figure D-6, left. Selecting a station places that station in priority. The
priority station is shown at the bottom of the display above PB #8, along
with its program options (Figure D-6, right). If more than one station is
selected, the priority station is the first in the sequence LC, RC, L, R, C.
To review or modify the program for the stations not in priority, it is
necessary to deselect the higher priority stations. This brings the desired
station into priority and displays its programming options. If no nuclear
station is selected, no program options are displayed.

Selectable options which pertain to the weapon in priority (as shown at
the bottom of the display over PB #8) are displayed above PBs #6-9. To
change an option, press the button below it, then follow the same
procedures used during the loading option selection. Some restrictions
may apply based on delivery option or selections made during loading.
Notice that function and chute delay are no longer selectable. To display
the selectable option for the other loaded bombs, deselect the higher
priority stations.

List

The display initializes with LIST boxed at PB #4. With LIST boxed,
options are shown below each loaded station for up to three weapons
(Figure D-7, left). The options shown are for the priority station plus the
next two loaded stations in priority sequence (be sure to check PB #8 to
ensure you are changing the desired weapon).

You may retain the options for each bomb or you can declutter the display
by unboxing LIST, which returns to the format of Figure D-7, right and
stores the options in the CC and PACS memory. Note that with LIST
unboxed, the A/G delivery page data is displayed.

ARMING

Nuclear bomb arming requires three steps: PAL enabling, placing the
nuclear consent switches in both cockpits to ARM, and satisfying a unique
signal generator (USG) code. In addition, unlocking the rack is required
prior to release. B61-0 through B61-2 weapons do not have a unique
signal generator; B61-3 and later weapons do have one.

Both nuclear consent switches must be placed to ARM to gain access to
the ARM mode. Placing both switches to ARM results in the removal of
the NUCLEAR CONSENT REQ’D TO ARM advisory and display of SEL
USG or ARM at PB #12, depending on what bomb type is being armed
(Figure D-13). If the bomb being armed does not have a USG, ARM is
displayed at PB #12 at this point and the next step of selecting the USG
code is bypassed.

If the bomb has a USG code, press PB #12, SEL USG. This action causes
the phrase “ENTER (a five-digit number) TO PREARM CODE XXXXX” to
appear. Also, numerals 0-9 appear adjacent to PBs #1-10 and the legend
at PB #12 changes to ARM (Figure D-14). Duplicate the USG numbers
exactly, just like you did for the PAL code.

The number 17283 tells the bomb it is being armed by an F-15E. This
provides a coded voltage to preclude stray voltage affecting the arming
process. It is not a security code (like PAL) and is printed in the nuclear

checklist.

WEAPON RELEASE
Unlocking

After the A/G master mode is selected and the nuclear consent switches
are both out of the SAFE position, the UNLK CONT legend appears
adjacent to PB #1. To begin the final release sequence select UNLK
CONT. This electrically unlocks the BRU-47/A for the weapon in priority,
boxes UNLK CONT and changes the priority weapon’s status to UNLK
(Figure D-22).

As you recall, the priority release sequence for nuclear weapons is LC, RC,
L, R, and C. The desired weapon can be placed in priority by unboxing
higher priority stations until the desired station is in priority. The
priority station can be confirmed by boxing LIST and checking PB #8.

Alternate Release

If all prerequisites for release have been met but the bomb does not come
off using either pickle button, rotating the armament control knob to
ALTN REL makes the JETT button a third pickle button for releasing
armed weapons (Figure D-25). Note, however, that this is a “hot” pickle
button and the bomb will bypass any computed release and drop
immediately.

Emergency Release

As previously mentioned, the panic button can be used to release armed
nuclear weapons if all release prerequisites have been met. This method
applies only to bombs on the LC and RC stations. All conventional carted
pylons and/or stores will also be released, such as external fuel tanks.

SELECTIVE JETTISON

The PACS selective jettison mode permits jettisoning any or all nuclear
stores. It includes a positive safing feature where all power is removed
from the weapon interface before jettison. Only the pilot can perform the
jettison function. However, IAW the two-man concept, both crew
members must actuate their nuclear consent switch from the safe and
sealed position to JETTISON ENABLE or ARM. This allows the bomb
racks to be unlocked.

Initiation

The pilot selects A/G SEL JETT on the armament control panel. This
removes all MON/SAFE/ARM power from the weapon interface, locks all
bomb racks, deselects all weapon stations, and brings up the A/G
JETTISON display on the FCP MPCD and all PACS displays

(Figure D-27). However, selections can only be made by the pilot on the
FCP MPCD.

Next, nuclear consent must be given in both cockpits.

until safing has been attempted. If a selected weapon does not indicate
SAFE, a display like Figure D-30 results. SAFE at PB #13 and SAFE
STATUS UNSAT caution appears above PB #8 when A/G SEL JETT is
selected. Further discussion of nuclear cautions are later in this
workbook.

You must box SAFE to apply safing power to the weapon. The display
changes to the safe weapon format previously seen (Figure D-28, left) once
the weapon reports SAFE to the PACS. The MON and OFF will appear

TRAINING

The PACS has a feature that allows you to practice nuclear procedures
with or without training stores loaded on the aircraft. For both modes any
PAL code will work as long as the number of digits is correct.

Without Training Stores

To practice nuclear procedures without releasing practice weapons, box
A/G TRNG on the ARMT menu and then select NUC LOAD or you can go
to the NUC LOAD page first and then box TRNG at PB #15. Next,
program the simulated load in the same manner as previously described
for real weapons. Procedures for monitoring, enabling, arming, and
releasing are identical to the real ones. Note that NUCLEAR TRAINING
is always present on the PACS display (Figure D-33).

There are two other differences in this mode. First, the pickle button does
not send a weapon release signal to the station. Instead, the PACS counts
the number of “pickles” and deletes weapon symbology appropriately.
When all simulated weapons are gone, RESET appears beside PB #3
(Figure D-34). Pressing it reloads the PACS program and you can
continue training.

With Training Stores

You can also practice nuclear procedures using training ordnance instead
of the real bombs. The training weapons you can program are BDU-38s
and MK-106/BDU-338s carried in a SUU-20.

Loading

The first step is to load the real weapon types and options that you want
to simulate into the PACS. You use the procedures for real bombs; do not
box TRNG. After the options are set you must unbox all the stations at
the top of the display before the display looks like Figure D-35. Then
press PB #7 to bring up the NUC TRAINING STORES LOAD format
shown in Figure D-386.

If you have a BDU-38 on the left CFT, press PB #15 to box BDU-38 and
then PB #19 for the station (Figure D-86). A boxed BDU-88 replaces the
weapon quantity so you have a ready inventory of actual stores aboard.
When you have finished loading, deselect the station to prepare to load the

Next, box a practice bomb type (MK-106, BDU-33), its positions in the
SUU, and press ENTER. The bomb legend appears beside its sequence
number under the selected station (Figure D-38). Do not load any stores
other than the ones you want to drop as simulated NUCs. Other practice
bombs in the SUU-20 can be dropped from the conventional PACS.
Repeat for other practice bombs. Note: MK-106 is no longer available in
the Air Force inventory. For retarded deliveries a BDU-38 must be used.
TREL, TPULL, and TBURST shown for a BDU-38 will be significantly
different than a high drag weapon.

Remember that practice bombs come out of a SUU-20 in order, 1 through
6; this cannot be altered.

Release

Procedures for releasing practice bombs are the same as for real nuclear
weapons.

When RDY is displayed, verify the priority program at PB #5 matches the
selected station. Toggle PB #5 if required. A mismatch could cause
incorrect delivery computations.

Dry Run/Tone

Two other training-only options are available when you move the master
arm to ARM in the delivery sequence; they are TONE and DRY RUN
(Figure D-39).

Boxing TONE causes a tone to be produced from UHF #1 when either
pickle button is held depressed; it stops when the PACS receives the CC
release signal. It can be used for radar bomb scoring (RBS) or with
weapons release.

DRY RUN inhibits actual weapon release but causes the display to react
as if release had occurred. The priority weapon legends drop off but can
be reinstated by unboxing DRY RUN. This feature lets you make a
practice run before actual release.

NUCLEAR CAUTIONS

The F-15E caution system alerts you to abnormal conditions involving
loaded nuclear weapons. During operations the PACS continuously
monitors the nuclear loaded stations and, if a caution situation occurs, it
immediately notifies you via the MASTER CAUTION and NUCLEAR
CAUTION lights in each cockpit. The caution is also written on the PACS
display. If more than one caution occurs, the one of highest priority is
shown. Ifa similar condition is present at more than one station, then the
caution for the station which has highest priority for release is displayed.
A typical nuclear caution legend is shown in Figure D-40.

In this case, the LC station did not properly arm after the 60 second USG
countdown. The crew deselected the RC to keep it armed and then
selected SAFE. The weapon did not safe within 20 seconds and the
caution remains. The next step would be to select OFF and return to base

GENERAL

The PACS display on a MPD/MPCD is the primary means of controlling
and monitoring nuclear weapons in the F-15E. It can be called up and
operated from either cockpit which gives great flexibility. Some
traditional switches are still used, such as the nuclear consent switches
for two-man control.

The objective of the following information is to explain the meaning of the
numerous nuclear display formats and symbology. To do this, you will be
taken through a typical sequence of events for a nuclear operation. The
“how to” aspect is the primary thrust in the CBT lesson.

A typical mission configuration might be as depicted in Figure D-1 with
three external fuel tanks and two nuclear weapons on the CFT stations.
This is the load you will see on subsequent nuclear PACS displays in this
lesson.

SWITCHES

The switches required for nuclear weapons operations that are not
integrated into the PACS display are detailed below and shown in
Figure D-2.

Master Mode Select

To deliver any air-to-surface weapon you must select the A/G master
mode. Changing to other master modes locks the racks.

Emergency Jettison Select Switch

The “panic” button releases the priority weapon on a CFT station if the
rack has been unlocked. The weapon may be jettisoned armed. Any
conventional weapons that are carted on any station will also be
jettisoned.

Armament Control Panel

ALTN REL - provides an alternate means to release a nuclear weapon
which is armed, unlocked, and otherwise ready.

A/G SEL JETT - allows selective jettison of nuclear weapons in a safe
condition.

MAN FF, MAN RET - these modes are inhibited with nuclear weapons on
board and will cause all stations to deselect, lock, and remove power from
the bomb interface. The pilot must exit manual settings and restart the
entire nuclear arming sequence.

COMBAT - provides a preprogrammed combat jettison mode for the fuel
tanks if they are on board. The first push jettisons the centerline tank.
The second push jettisons the wing tanks.

JETT BUTTON - initiates the selected mode.

MASTER ARM - provides power to deliver a weapon.

AGW-6 D-2


Text from AGW-6_Nuclear_PACS_page_9.jpeg:
Nuclear Consent Switches

These guarded switches, one in each cockpit, have three positions:

SAFE - either switch in SAFE deenergizes arming and release
circuitry. Allows the guard to be closed for safety wiring.

ARM - both switches in ARM energizes arming and release circuitry.
JETTISON ENABLE - deenergizes arming and energizes release
circuitry, and provides rack unlock consent to the PACS. All weapons
must be released in a SAFE condition. Enabling combinations:

e onein JETTISON ENABLE, one in ARM

e bothin JETTISON ENABLE

e both in ARM
