ADI

The ADI shows radar altitude data in two ways. If radar altitude is
selected on the Data 1 page of the UFC (Figure D-2), a digital readout is
presented beneath baro altitude (Figure D-3). It will also be displayed as
an analog scale at all times when the terrain following radar is on.

HUD

The HUD presents radar altitude in two ways. When selected on the
Data 1 page of the UFC (Figure D-2) radar altitude is displayed digitally
below baro altitude. It may also be displayed as a thermometer-like
analog altitude scale. Whenever the radar altimeter is powered on
(whether or not, Data 1 PB #9 is *) and the radar altitude is less than or
equal to 1500 feet, the thermometer will be displayed (Figure D-5) if
within radar altimeter pitch/bank limits. The thermometer is
automatically removed from the HUD when aircraft altitude is greater
than 1800 feet AGL for more than 3 seconds. It is automatically
redisplayed immediately upon descent through 1500 feet AGL. The
thermometer can be removed from the HUD through the HUD
programming display unless the TFR is on, when it will always be
displayed below 1500 feet AGL as described above.

Failure Indications

If the radar altimeter is in OFF or OVERRIDE, experiences a failure, or
radar altimeter altitude/bank/pitch limits are exceeded, the digital
readouts display OFF if selected for display (UFC Data 1). If the altitude
thermometer was present, it disappears. If radar altitude was not
selected for display, there will be no indication of failure on the HUD.

A word of caution: OFF may not display immediately after exceeding
attitude limits. It may still change or freeze to a set altitude for some
time in rapidly changing attitudes before changing to OFF. Rely on the
RALT reading only when within parameter limits and a stable attitude.

AUTOPILOT

The autopilot, through the automatic flight control system, can
automatically maintain a desired attitude, altitude, heading, and/or
course. The modes and submodes are engaged and monitored through the
up-front control (UFC) and may be overridden and/or disengaged at any
time.

Modes and Submodes

Autopilot Disengagement

The autopilot (including submodes) is disengaged by pressing the paddle
switch on either cockpit control stick or by exceeding basic autopilot
limits. Submodes are disengaged by deselecting them on the UFC
autopilot submenu or by exceeding individual submode limits.

Attitude/Heading Hold

These are the basic autopilot modes. When engaged, it maintains the
current pitch attitude and if the current bank angle is greater than 7°, it
maintains that bank angle. It is referred to as attitude (ATT) hold. Ifthe
bank angle is equal to or less than 7°, it maintains current pitch attitude
and wings level. This is referred to as heading (HDG) hold. For basic
autopilot engagement, the aircraft must be within +45° of pitch, 60° of
bank, +25°/second roll rate, or within -1 to +3 incremental Gs. If outside
these parameters, the autopilot does not engage, and if engaged, it
disengages. Also, if any CAS axis disengages, either paddle switch is
depressed, or the INS attitude is invalid, the autopilot will not engage or
will disengage.

AVI-10 D-10


Text from AVI-10_Radar_Altimeter__Autopilot_page_17.jpeg:
Altitude Hold/Select

In the altitude hold (ALT HOLD) submode, the autopilot keeps the
aircraft at a specified altitude. In the altitude select (ALT SELECT)
submode, the autopilot flies the aircraft to an aircrew entered altitude at a
climb/descent rate controlled by the aircrew’s throttle inputs. In either
submode the altitude reference may be barometric (BARO) or radar
(RDR), as selected by the crew. ALT HOLD or ALT SELECT can be
engaged/disengaged simultaneously with basic autopilot engagement, or
separately added to/deleted from basic autopilot. The altitude submodes
will not operate separately from (i.e., without) the basic autopilot. Either
submode can be disengaged along with the basic autopilot by the paddle
switch, by exceeding parameters, or individually by deselecting the
submode on the UFC autopilot submenu.

BARO With BARO selected, the aircraft flies the barometric

HOLD altitude at engagement as measured by the air data
computer. If control stick steering is used, it
references the new altitude when the stick is released.

RDR Radar altitude hold maintains the existing altitude at

HOLD engagement as long as it is between 380 and 50,000
feet. The radar altitude hold mode is not
recommended for use over rolling/rugged terrain below
5000 feet above ground level (AGL).

BARO SEL/ The crew can select a barometric or radar altitude

RDR SEL by using the autopilot submenu of the UFC. Both
altitude select modes use a constant airspeed/mach
profile to climb to the selected altitude and a constant
airspeed profile to descend. The autopilot reverts to
the altitude hold submode when the selected altitude
is reached. The desired climb or descent airspeed
should be achieved prior to engaging the ALT SELECT
submode. The crew then initiates and controls the
climb or descent with the throttles. Airspeed may be
adjusted using control stick steering during the climb
or descent. Consult TO 1F-15E-1, Section 1 for system
operating limits.

D-11 AVI-10


Text from AVI-10_Radar_Altimeter__Autopilot_page_18.jpeg:
BLENDED _ Blended mode allows the aircrew to add terrain

MODE following protection to the autopilot altitude hold
mode. Blended mode maintains the current baro or
radar altitude until the auto terrain following (ATF)
system determines that positive Gs are required to
maintain the TF set clearance plane. Once the terrain
has been cleared, the aircraft automatically recaptures
the previous baro or radar altitude. The blended mode
is not operational in manual terrain following.

Automatic Terrain Following (ATF)

The autopilot can also be coupled to the terrain following system to
provide automatic, low altitude, terrain following flight. This system can
be used with all autopilot submodes.

Steer Modes

The autopilot can also be coupled with one of five azimuth steering
submodes to automatically fly a desired course. The options, heading
(HDG), navigation (NAV), TACAN (TCN)/course (CRS), or ground track
(GT), are selected on the HSI and engaged through the UFC. They are
compatible with the altitude hold submodes, with auto TFR, and function
in all master modes but air-to-air. Disengagement is done through the
paddle switch or the UFC by deselecting STR MODE.

HDG maintains the selected command heading on the HSI.

NAV maintains a great circle course from present position to the
current aircraft sequence point.

TCN steers to a 45° course intercept, and then maintains the
TACAN course set on the HSI.

CRS uses TACAN steering equations to intercept a selected
course to the current NAV steerpoint. CRS alternates with
TCN on the HSI.

AVI-10 D-12


Text from AVI-10_Radar_Altimeter__Autopilot_page_19.jpeg:
GT holds the ground track heading at engagement. A specific
GT cannot be selected on the HSI with autopilot steer mode
engaged. To change GT, you must use control stick
steering.

Three steer modes, ALG, ILST, and ILSN, cannot be coupled to the
autopilot.

Control Stick Steering (CSS)

Control stick steering during autopilot operation means manually moving
the stick in pitch and/or roll without disengaging the autopilot. This
allows the aircraft to be maneuvered without reengaging the autopilot
every time. Stick force required varies from 1 to 3 lbs; once the stick force
is relieved, the autopilot resumes normal operation. No lights come on to
indicate CSS; however, should an autopilot mode or submode disengage
during CSS due to excessive force, the AUTO PLT caution is triggered.

CSS in roll will begin a turn and when pressure is removed, will reacquire
the selected HSI steering except for GT steering. In the GT steering
mode, if CSS is engaged, the bank angle must be manually reduced to less
than 7° to capture a new ground track. If the bank angle is greater than
or equal to 7° the autopilot will enter roll attitude hold until the bank
angle is reduced to less than 7°.

Pitch control stick steering while in ALT HOLD mode resets the altitude
reference to be held when CSS is terminated. Pitch control stick steering
during “altitude select” only resets the airspeed/mach reference to be held
while climbing or descending to the selected altitude.

Figure D - 11. Autopilot Submenu.

For the ALT HOLD mode to be displayed, SEL OFF must be displayed at
PB #8. If an altitude is displayed at PB #8 (Figure D-12, page D-19)
PB #8 will display ALT SELECT.

The altitude to be held may be adjusted with pitch CSS by applying pitch
pressure to the control stick without disengaging the autopilot.

D-19 AVI-10


Text from AVI-10_Radar_Altimeter__Autopilot_page_26.jpeg:
Altitude Select

There must first be an altitude displayed at PB #8 on the UFC for ALT
SELECT to be displayed at PB #3 (Figure D-12). If the scratchpad is
blank, pressing PB #8 momentarily toggles between SEL OFF and the
last valid altitude entry. At central computer power up, PB #8 defaults to
SEL OFF and the toggled default altitude is 31,000 feet. Enter the
desired altitude value into the scratchpad and press PB #8. Entries
between 10 and 500 transfer to PB #8 as values between 1000 and 50,000;
entries between 1000 and 50,000 transfer as entered. Once an altitude is
displayed at PB #8, ALT SELECT is displayed at PB #3 and the mode is
available for selection.

The altitude reference may be either RDR or BARO, as selected and
displayed at PB #4. Although you would normally select the altitude
reference prior to engaging the ALT SELECT mode, you can toggle
between RDR and BARO with ALT SELECT engaged. When switching
from RDR to BARO, the selected altitude is compared to ground level. If
the selected altitude is at least 1000 feet above ground level, the reference
switches to BARO. Ifthe selected altitude is less than 1000 feet above
ground level, PB #4 displays BARO momentarily then changes back to
RDR, and RDR remains the altitude reference. However, there is no
interlock when initially in BARO to prevent selecting a BARO ALT
SELECT that is below ground level.

To engage the submode, the aircrew first establishes the desired
climb/descent airspeed, then presses PB #3. Submode initiation results in
capture of the current calibrated airspeed and/or mach which is displayed
at PB #7. Airspeed/Mach or airspeed is only displayed at PB #7 when the
submode is actually engaged, as in Figure D-12. As the throttles are
moved, the aircraft descends at a constant calibrated airspeed or climbs at
a constant calibrated airspeed, until reaching a transition mach which it
then maintains until level off. The aircrew controls rate of climb or
descent with throttle movement.

Use CSS to change the calibrated airspeed in the climb or descent by
applying pitch pressure to the stick until the new airspeed is obtained.

AVI-10 D - 20


Text from AVI-10_Radar_Altimeter__Autopilot_page_27.jpeg:
The aircrew can deselect the ALT SELECT submode in three ways.
Pressing PB #8 toggles to SEL OFF and the autopilot reverts to altitude
hold at the current altitude. Pressing PB #8 deselects the ALT SELECT
submode and the autopilot reverts to attitude/heading hold. Depressing
either cockpit paddle switch disengages the autopilot completely (basic
autopilot and all submodes).

Steer Modes

To couple a steer mode with the autopilot, the desired mode must be
selected on the HSI display (Figure D-14, left). Whichever steer mode is
boxed (except ILST, ILSN, or ALG) is the one coupled. If ILST or ILSN is
boxed on the HSI at A/P engagement, INV is shown on the UFC at PB #2
and the steer mode cannot be selected. If ALG is boxed at autopilot
engagement, the steer mode changes to NAV on the HSI. With the
autopilot engaged in ALG or ILS steering, selections are removed from the
HSI since they are not autopilot compatible (Figure D-14, left). The boxed
steer mode also appears on the autopilot submenu at PB #2 (Figure D-14,
right). By pressing PB #2, the steer mode is preselected or engaged; an
asterisk shows the status. “A / P” appears on the HSI (Figure D-14, left)
when a steer mode is engaged, and the steer mode also appears on UFC
Menu 1 and the top line of the autopilot submenu when engaged.

The steer mode cannot be selected in the air-to-air master mode. PB #2 on
the UFC autopilot submenu will be blanked in the air-to-air master mode.

RADAR ALTIMETER & AUTOPILOT

INTRODUCTION

This workbook is your guide in studying the radar altimeter and the
autopilot. These two seemingly unrelated systems have been combined in
a CBT lesson which gives “hands-on” experience. The autopilot uses the
radar altimeter in some of its submodes. As part of a computer-based
training (CBT) lesson, this workbook should be read prior to taking the
CBT instruction.

With a steer mode engaged, the autopilot status is displayed as “A/P
AHDG, A/P NAV, A/P TCN, A/P CRS, or A/P GT” (Figure D-15, left). If
both an altitude function and a steer mode are engaged, the status is
displayed with the steer mode first; i.e., AYP NAV/ALT as in Figure D-15,
right. The Menu 1 autopilot status and the autopilot submenu status will
always be identical.

Note: To distinguish between the heading hold (wings level) basic
autopilot mode and the autopilot heading hold steer mode (as selected on

the HSD, the autopilot status line will show AHDG for the steer mode and
HDG for wings level basic autopilot.

Submode Preselection

Altitude and steering submodes can be preselected on the autopilot
submenu by pressing the button beside the desired submode with the
autopilot disengaged. Then, when the A/P button on the UFC is pressed,
they become engaged. It is not necessary to first select basic autopilot and
then add submodes. Failing to check the autopilot submenu prior to
engagement could give an unexpected response.

HUD

The engaged steer mode is also shown on the HUD by the letter “A” in
front of the steering mode in the data block (Figure D-16).

Autopilot Light

A green “A/P” advisory light in both cockpits indicates that an autopilot
mode is engaged. However, when the auto terrain following (ATF) radar
is in control of the aircraft, the “A/P” advisory lights illuminate only when
a steer mode is engaged. In other words, the “A/P” advisory lights only
come on when an aircrew selects an autopilot function on the UFC, not
when the ATF uses the autopilot.

(Figure D-17) as a display caution. When it appears, it also illuminates
the FLT CONTR major category light and the MASTER CAUTION light.
These cautions are activated by an unsuccessful autopilot engagement
attempt (including submodes), by a malfunction-caused disengagement, or
exceeding CSS limits (including submode limits). To clear the AUTO PLT
caution and extinguish the FLT CONTR and MASTER CAUTION lights,
press the FCP MASTER CAUTION.

Figure D - 17. Autopilot Caution.
Autopilot Status Feedback

The autopilot caution indication logic is such that the “AUTO PLT”
display caution, “FLT CONTR” caution on the caution lights panel
(forward and AFT), and MASTER CAUTION are only displayed for
autopilot system failures disengagement via exceedance of limits. The
autopilot caution indications are not provided for aircrew initiated
autopilot disengagements (paddle switch or submode deselection).

If the autopilot is failing and the reason is unknown, go to the DETAIL,
AFCS, STATUS page. The top portion shows up to seven failures (last on
top of list) of the autopilot and/or TF system.

RADAR ALTIMETER
Description and Function

The radar altimeter system is composed of the antenna, the receiver/
transmitter (R/T), and associated cables and hardware. It sends out a
low-powered radar beam directly below the aircraft which accurately
measures height above ground level (AGL) altitude. The signal is divided
and sent to each AIU where it is tested for validity and currency. Then,
the central computer takes the valid output from either AIU for display
and use by other systems. The readout of radar altitude can be presented
on several cockpit displays (UFC, ADI, HUD, and TF E-scope). The
information is also used by the autopilot in the radar altitude hold or
select submodes, by the low altitude warning system (LAWS), by the
terrain following (TF) system, and by the ground collision warning system
(GCWS). The radar altimeter is sometimes referred to as the combined
altitude radar altimeter (CARA) or RALT (radar altimeter).

Parameters

The operating limits for the radar altimeter are as follows:
e Altitude - 50,000 feet to ground level
e Pitch attitude - +60°
e 6Bank angle - 60°

Should these limits be exceeded, the cockpit digital readouts change to
OFF.

Radar Altimeter Switch

With the switch in the OFF position, the unit is turned off (Figure D-1); in
the ON position it is turned on for normal operation. The OVERRIDE
position turns the unit off, but allows manual TF to be accomplished.
