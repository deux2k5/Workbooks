Text from AVI-11_Built-In_Test_BIT_page_16.jpeg:
Even if the test on a particular system/component takes only milliseconds,
the system in test must appear in the in-test window for at least 2 seconds
for the BIT to be accomplished. If the component in test just flashes, and
the BIT menu returns or continues to the next component in test, a BIT was
not accomplished on that system.

Initiating BIT places STOP at PB #19. Selecting STOP (PB #19) on an
in-test submenu terminates the BIT and returns the display to the BIT
menu (Figure D-7). Pressing STOP

e does not stop the radar BIT (use auto acq switch/reject)

e does not stop the ICSCP/RICP BIT (voice warning continues to
completion) or RALT (radar altimeter, only lasts a few seconds)

If a system BIT takes an excessive amount of time to complete, you may
attempt to terminate the BIT by pressing STOP. If the system in test
remains in BIT for another 5 seconds after STOP is pressed, ESCAPE
replaces the STOP legend. Pressing ESCAPE is designed to reset the BIT
routine in the CC and return the display to the BIT menu. However,
system lock up may occur when ESCAPE is pressed, and the BIT system as
well as the component that is hung may be unavailable for the remainder of
the mission.

AVI-11 D-10


Text from AVI-11_Built-In_Test_BIT_page_17.jpeg:
On the ground, the BIT menu displays all the systems that have an
initiated BIT capability. An in-flight BIT is not allowed on the
multipurpose display processor (DSPL), air data computer (ADC),
exceedence counter (the “G meter” for the OWS) (EXCS), inertial navigation
system (INS), automatic flight control system (AFCS), and embedded global
positioning system/inertial navigation system (EGI). An I-BIT causes
interruption of normal system operation and with these particular systems
flight safety could be affected (Figure D-8). They are removed from the BIT
menu.

Some systems are present conditionally. AIM displays at PB #2 on the
ground with the ASP PACS switch in OFF. PACS replaces AIM at PB #2
with the switch in ON. SFDR (PB #16) is only displayed when the CC gets
no response from the Signal Data Recorder (before TCTO 1F-15E-651) or
Standard Flight Data Recorder (after TCTO 1F-15E-651).

The LANT/RALT selection is removed from the BIT menu in-flight during
armed manual or auto terrain following radar operations.

To accomplish a full AUTO BIT, all avionics/systems to be checked must be
turned on and timed in. Any equipment not turned on/timed in will appear
as failed in the BIT failure window.

AVI-11 D-16


Text from AVI-11_Built-In_Test_BIT_page_23.jpeg:
After starting an AUTO BIT (Figure D-11, left), the following cues indicate
AUTO BIT operation.

All MPD/MPCDs go blank for a minimum of two seconds and a maximum of
15 seconds. Then they alternately display gray scales with blank screens,
ending with gray scales and displaying “MPDP TEST PASSED” or “MPDP
TEST FAILED,” as appropriate. The total fuel reported to the OWS is also
displayed. This value should be checked against the fuel gauges. Five
seconds later, the gray scales disappear, and the test continues.

Reselecting the BIT display format will display either the BIT menu or the
in-test submenu depending on AUTO BIT progress.

If an AUTO BIT hangs up at a particular system/component, all
systems/components downstream from the hang-up can be BIT checked by
individually selecting an initiated BIT for those items.

When the AUTO BIT is complete, the BIT menu automatically returns with
any systems/components that failed their BIT displayed in the failure

AIM/PACS I-BIT

AIM I-BIT Operation

When the radar power knob is moved out of OFF, an AIM-120 BIT initiate
signal is applied to each station (in missile launch sequence) with a missile
aboard. Each missile is tested individually, requiring about 4 seconds per
missile.

The crew can initiate the same AIM-120 BIT routine from the BIT display.
AIM is displayed on the BIT menu adjacent to PB #2 (Figure D-14), unless
the PACS consent switch is ON, in which case PACS appears at PB #2.
Pressing AIM (PB #2) initiates the AIM I-BIT for all AIM-120s in sequence.

PACS I-BIT

The PACS I-BIT is strictly a maintenance function. PACS only appears as
an option at PB #2 when the PACS consent switch on the avionics status
panel is in the ON position. This switch must be electronically held in the
ON position. Once ground power is removed, the switch automatically
returns to the OFF (or “AIM”) position.

In the unlikely situation that PACS is displayed by PB #2 after engine
start, have the ground crew check the PACS consent switch (Figure D-15).

WARNING

You must shut down one engine before the
crew chief can enter the nose wheelwell.

The PACS I-BIT concludes with firing voltages being sent to all weapons
stations. Therefore, we stress again, the PACS I-BIT is strictly a
maintenance function.

Remote Map Reader I-BIT

Prior to TCTO 1F-15E-700, an RMR I-BIT is accomplished by pressing RMR
(PB #6) on the BIT2 menu (Figure D-16) which calls up the RMR test
submenu and starts the RMR BIT. The TSD map blanks and several
seconds later the display automatically adjusts the color, followed by the
display of the TSD/RMR (Figure D-16). Total time required to run an RMR
I-BIT is approximately 20-25 seconds. Pressing STOP on the BIT display is
required to get back to the normal TSD display and to return the BIT
display to the BIT menu format. This discussion assumes you have the
TSD up, as well as the BIT display, on the MPD/MPCD.

AFCS I-BIT

Prior to starting an AFCS I-BIT ensure that:

Weight is on wheels

Landing gear handle is down

Engine RPM is less than 80%

Holding brake is set

Pitch and roll ratio switches are in AUTO

ANTISKID is NORM

The AFCS I-BIT takes approximately 1 minute and 40 seconds to complete.
To prevent an aborted or failed AFCS BIT, do not operate AFCS
switches/controls (flaps, speedbrake, etc.), do not rest your hands on the
stick, or feet on the rudder pedals during the BIT.

AVI-11


Text from AVI-11_Built-In_Test_BIT_page_31.jpeg:
An AFCS I-BIT is accomplished by pressing and holding the BIT (consent)
button on the CAS panel (FCP), and then pressing and releasing AFCS

(PB #9) on the BIT menu (Figure D-17). The BIT (consent) button interlock
prevents inadvertent AFCS BIT initiation since the flight controls are
automatically moved (quite violently) during an AFCS BIT. Once AFCS
BIT begins “AFCS IN TEST,” (Figure D-17, top right), the CAS panel BIT
(consent) button can be released.

INS I-BIT

An INS I-BIT will not normally be done prior to flight since it takes
approximately 15 minutes to complete the test, and a full gyrocompass
alignment must then be accomplished. If an INS BIT is accomplished,
maintenance TOs would be required to interpret the information presented.

The discussions on the next 3 pages provide information on what the
aircrew could see (and in some cases hear) as the I-BIT on various systems
are being accomplished. You will not normally observe the BIT process in
such exacting detail. Scan the discussions for general understanding only.
It is not necessary for you to memorize all these indications.

MAINTENANCE BIT

Maintenance BITs are available on the ground and in flight. Any time a
malfunction is known or suspected, a recording of a MAINT BIT may be
required prior to shutdown. If CC mux bus failures occur, the aircrew must
access the MAINT AUDIT page to clear these failures and allow full system
operation.

AFCS failures may be cleared without accessing the MAINT AUDIT page.
For the AFCS, MAINT AUDIT provides a visual check for the existence or
absence of failure codes.

MAINT Submenu

Selection of the MAINT submenu from the BIT menu (Figure D-20, left)
provides an in-depth maintenance oriented test of the systems shown on the
periphery of the MAINT submenu (Figure D-20, right). For example,
selecting PB #1 brings up a display (Figure D-20, bottom) that permits BITs
to be run on listed system components. To stop a running BIT, select
STOP, which appears at PB# 19 only while the BIT is running.

Exit the component selection page by pressing the button next to the system
being checked to return to the maintenance submenu, or the MAINT button
to return to the BIT menu. Interpretation of some MAINT data pages
requires the use of a technical order maintenance code table.

Power interruptions result in accumulated mux bus failures in the AFCS
and CC nonvolatile memory, identified by 5 A/B and 6 A/B suffixes (Figure
D-21, left). This is caused by the BIT system running continuous and
periodic BITs on equipment which the system thinks has failed. When this
occurs, the nonvolatile memory must be cleared.

AFCS mux bus failures can be cleared by holding the paddle switch

depressed, while pressing and releasing the BIT (consent) button on the
CAS panel. This resets the audit BIT codes to zeros.

INTRODUCTION
Description/Function

The built-in test (BIT) system is a CC resident program that provides the
aircrew with the status of the avionics system components. For the BIT
system to operate, the CC and AIU 1 must be operative. Some of the BITs
are aircrew initiated from an MPD/MPCD BIT display. For these BITs,
obviously, the MPDP must be operative.

BIT Test Methods

Three different types of BIT testing methods are used.

Continuous BIT

Provides constant monitoring of the avionics system for presence, value and
logic. This method does not interfere with the normal operation of avionics
that are being tested.

Periodic BIT

Automatically inserts test signals and replies during operation which do not
interfere with normal operation of the avionic system.

Initiated BIT

Is “initiated” by the aircrew and causes interruption of normal
system/component operation during the test.

When equipment is turned on, a BIT or a portion of an initiated BIT
(40-100%) is automatically accomplished. This turn-on BIT is sometimes
referred to as an operational BIT.

BIT INDICATORS

BIT, caution and MPD/MPCD indications provide the aircrew with
continuous status of the avionics equipment.

D-1 AVI-11


Text from AVI-11_Built-In_Test_BIT_page_8.jpeg:
System Cautions

When a system/component fails a BIT, the AV BIT caution light
illuminates. Ifthe failure logic meets the aircraft caution system logic, a
MASTER CAUTION light, yellow caution light and MPD/MPCD caution
legend may also result. The AV BIT light (BIT failure) itself does not
illuminate the MASTER CAUTION light, but depressing the MASTER
CAUTION light in either cockpit does extinguish the AV BIT light. The AV
BIT light is your cue to check the BIT display for information concerning a
failed BIT.

Equipment Latch Indicators

Failure of an avionics system component to pass a BIT check causes its
indicator on the avionics status panel in the nose wheel well to latch (Figure
D-1, left).

An MPD/MPCD or HUD BIT failure causes the BIT ball on the display
itself to latch (Figure D-1, right). When preflighting the aircraft, check the
avionics status panel for failure indications and coordinate with
maintenance personnel, as required.

Text from AVI-11_Built-In_Test_BIT_page_9.jpeg:
The MPD/MPCD and HUD BIT latch indicators can be reset by turning the
unit OFF and then ON, or running a successful BIT on the component.

BIT DISPLAYS
BIT Menu

The two BIT menus are accessed from any MPD/MPCD by pressing PB #20
on display Menu 1. Once the main BIT menu is displayed, BIT menu 2
(BIT2 legend) may be accessed by pressing PB #12 on the BIT display.
Subsequently, pressing PB #12 (BIT legend) will return to the main BIT
page (Figure D-2).
