BASIC SYSTEM COMPONENTS
Central Computer System

System Description

The central computer system performs computations for aircraft
navigation and weapon delivery/control, and maintains the system
displays using information received from the other avionic components
and sensors. The received data is used during the OFP execution to
compute aircraft position, velocity, altitude, attitude for navigation,
weapon delivery and display functions. The central computer system is
made up of many components, including the central computer (CC) and
the avionics mux buses, which are discussed below.

To aid your understanding of the avionic system operation, the
components are grouped by function (Figure D-1). The avionic system
functional block diagram graphically depicts the CC as the “heart” of your
weapons system. The avionics are designed to allow information to flow
back and forth between the CC and other systems. This design allows
information to be redundantly displayed and easily manipulated.

Central Computer

Description

The very high speed integrated circuit (VHSIC) CC is a high speed, stored
program, general purpose digital computer that receives data from control
panels and subsystems aboard the aircraft and performs mission oriented
computations on that data. The CC ADA-based software program (OFP)
provides the computer with guidance to perform its different functions.
The CC itself is made up of three central processing units (CPUs) with 512
K of nonvolatile memory per CPU (1536 K total). The CC operates at a
minimum of 3 million instructions per second (8 MIPS) per CPU when
performing the OFP. Two CPUs carry out primary functions while the
third works as a “shadow” processor, backing up important routines being
processed by the other two. The CC is powered as long as one main
generator is on-line. A built-in CC battery keeps memory alive during
periods when generator power is not available, including when the CC is
shut down between flights.

D-5 AVI-1


Text from AVI-1_Avionics_Introduction_page_12.jpeg:
The following descriptions of components are specific to the F-15E.

Central Processing Unit (CPU): the CPU controls the instruction
execution sequence; processes the interrupt, arithmetic and logic
functions; does the calling and storing of data, and interfaces with other
aircraft equipment and avionic systems.

Input/Output W/O) Section: the I/O section provides mux bus channel and
data interface with other aircraft equipment and avionics systems via the
mux buses.

Main Memory Storage (MS): the MS provides storage for the OFP, data
from other aircraft equipment and avionics systems, CPU data, and the
self-test program. The main store consists of random access memory
(RAM) backed up by nonvolatile core memory.

Power Supply: the power supply is controlled by the CC switch on the
GND PWR panel. The power supply then converts the aircraft AC input
power to operating voltages required for computer circuits.

Mission Cartridge (MC) and Data Transfer Module (DTM): mission
information can be loaded into the CC via the MC and/or DTM. The MC
and DTM are programmed in the squadron and carried to the aircraft.
Once inserted into their receptacles in the FCP they can be “read” to
initialize mission data in the CC.

Function: of primary concern to the aircrew is that the OFP is the
program loaded into the CC that contains the instructions for processing
data necessary to do radar, general navigation, and weapon delivery
computations. Certain computer tasks are accomplished based on aircrew
desires. Basically, the CC provides the following capabilities to the
aircrew:

e Air-to-air steering and launch envelope computations for missiles
and gunnery computations.

e Air-to-ground steering and release for A/G weapons.

e Steering to sequence points, mark points, targets of opportunity
and TACAN stations, including instrument approaches.

e Avionics control via software programmable display formats.

AVI-1 D-6


Text from AVI-1_Avionics_Introduction_page_13.jpeg:
To accomplish these tasks, the CC OFP is made up of nine program
modules, each being a complete routine that does a specific part of the CC
program. These programs are contained within the main memory storage
of the CC, as shown previously in Figure D-2.

Most modules work in conjunction with other CC modules and other CC
equipment to accomplish these tasks. All functional modules are
processed under Executive Module control. Each module’s capabilities are
briefly outlined below. This is familiarization information only. Some
modules are discussed in more detail in later lessons.

@ CC Simulator Support Module
e Provides interface with the simulator host computer. (This
allows the F-15E simulator to use the same CC as the aircraft.)
This module is inactive during aircraft operations.

CC Subroutine Programs

The CC maintains subroutine programs within certain modules. The
programs access module-related data and, along with CC-stored
algorithms, generate new/backup data for aircrew use. Two subroutines
of note are the overload warning system (OWS) and mission navigator
(MN).

OWS - calculates aircraft maximum allowable G. Provides the
aircrew with aircraft overload conditions for dynamic flight. OWS
data is stored in CC memory for recall.

MN - corrected present position and velocity data. Allows position
and velocity updates independent of the GPS/INS. The data is also
used by the CC as a backup for INS present position and velocity.

Both the OWS and MN functions are covered in detail in later lessons.

Avionics Mux Buses

Normal Operation

As long as the CC is operational, it is the bus controller, or monitor, for all
mission data transfers between the CC and other avionic subsystems.
This is accomplished through the interface with two types of avionics mux
buses (the 1553 and H009). Each mux bus has primary (1, 2, and 5A) and
secondary (3, 4, and 5B) channels for the simultaneous transmission of
digital data. The secondary channels provide a redundant backup to the
avionics subsystems if the primary mux buses fail. The mux buses allow
the CC to interface with the:

Air data computer (ADC)/air data processor (ADP-with GPS)
Attitude heading reference set (AHRS)

Programmable armament control system (PACS)

Tactical electronic warfare system (TEWS)

Automatic flight control system (AFCS)

Radar

Avionics status panel (ASP)

Avionic interface units (AIU 1 & 2)

Engine diagnostic units (EDUs)

Global positioning system (GPS) (After TCTO 1F-15E-737)
Inertial navigation system (INS)

LANTIRN systems (TFR, NAV FLIR, TGT IR)
Multipurpose display processor (MPDP)

Digital map system (DMS) (After TCTO 1F-15E-700)
Signal data recorder system (SDRS)

CC Backup Operation

When the CC determines that it is in a no-go condition, it applies a no-go
command to the MPDP. This activates the MPDP software to take
command of one of the avionics mux buses. The MPDP becomes the
primary bus controller and is then able to communicate with the avionic
systems connected to that data bus. The MPDP receives data normally
acquired by the CC. A CC reset button in the FCP allows the pilot to
attempt a reset in the event of CC failure. CC failure is covered in detail
in the Degraded Avionics lesson.

Multipurpose Display System

System Description

AVI-1


Text from AVI-1_Avionics_Introduction_page_16.jpeg:
The multipurpose display system provides visual representation of flight,
navigation, attack, target, weapon and advisory data. The multipurpose
display system is made up of many components, including the
multipurpose display processor (MPDP) and the display’s mux buses,
which are discussed below.

Multipurpose Display Processor

Description

The MPDP is a multichannel video signal processor and symbol generator
that processes avionic subsystem data for the multipurpose display
system. It simultaneously drives eight display channels—one channel
dedicated to each display. The eight displays include four multipurpose
displays (MPDs), three multipurpose color displays (MPCDs) and the
head-up display (HUD) (Figure D-3). The MPDP is fully powered as long
as one main generator is on-line. It retains partial capability as long as
the emergency generator is operating (in AUTO or MANUAL).

Text from AVI-1_Avionics_Introduction_page_17.jpeg:
Function

The MPDP serves as a video processing and distribution center. It
produces stroke symbology and background video information for the
MPDs, MPCDs, HUD and the video tape recorder system (VTRS). The
MPDP converts all displays to composite video for the VTRS.

Operation

The CC supplies macro instructions (display data) to the MPDP as
directed by the CC OFP, which defines the displays to be produced. The
CC tells the MPDP which symbol(s) is (are) required, which display to put
them on, and at what grid location (x and y coordinates) to put them. The
MPDP has four separate power supplies and is designed so that failure of
one channel will not cause failure of the entire MPDP. Each power supply
drives two complete display channels. The MPDP/AIU 1 switch on the
GND PWR panel controls power to the MPDP power supply.

Display Mux Buses

Normal Operation

As long as the CC is operational, it is the primary display controller for
the MPDP. Display data transfer between the CC and MPDP occurs on
the display’s mux bus. The display’s mux bus has primary and secondary
channels (6A and 6B) for the simultaneous transmission of digital data.
The secondary channel provides a redundant backup to the MPDP if the
primary mux bus fails.

CC Backup Operation

A CC no-go signal is provided to the MPDP which causes the MPDP to
provide backup displays and avionics mux bus control. The MPDP
communicates and maintains the interface with the systems that are
required to provide the capability for returning to base and self-defense.
This includes a limited amount of display system formats. MPDP
degrades and failure will be covered in detail in the Degraded Avionics
lesson.

Avionics Interface Unit (AIU) Set

Description

The AIU set is composed of two AIUs (AIU 1 and AIU 2). Each AlUisa
signal processor used to control signal interfacing among the avionic
system components.

Function

The AIU set provides interfacing between the HOTAS controls/UFCs and
equipment being controlled. The AIU set also provides:

e Interface between the FCP/RCP UFCs

e Connection between the HOTAS controls/UFCs and the
components being controlled

e Memory for UHF preset channels

e Audio signal volume control (UHF, TACAN, warnings, etc.) from
the RICP/ICSCP

e Cautions, warnings and advisories

AIU 1 acts as primary bus controller for the digital database between the
UFCs and AIU 2. AIU 2 acts as backup bus controller for the digital
database between the UFCs and AIU 1. AIU 2 assumes control of the
digital data base when AIU 1 fails and performs all functions of AIU 1
except for control of equipment exclusively interfaced by AIU 1. Both
AITUs are normally powered by the main generators. AIU 1 will function
with emergency generator power only (AUTO or MANUAL).

Operation
Aircrew control of aircraft avionic systems is accomplished with the

HOTAS controls and UFCs. HOTAS/UFC input signals are processed by
the AIUs for interfacing with applicable systems.

Up-Front Control (UFC) Data Bus

The UFC data bus provides communication between both front and rear
cockpit UFCs and the AIU set. This same data bus provides
communication between AIU 1 and AIU 2. AIU 1 functions as the
primary UFC bus controller. AIU 2 is the secondary UFC bus controller.
The UFC sends keyboard/pushbutton control data and status information
to the AIU set via the UFC data bus. The AIU set sends menu and
display data to the UFC.

Normal Operation

The AIU set communicates with the CC by way of the avionics mux bus.
Information that is transferred between the AIU set and the CC includes
UFC display and control data, avionic systems modes, controls and status
data, cautions/warnings/advisories and UHF/IFF initialization data.

CC Backup Operation

The AIU set communicates with the MPDP by way of the avionics mux
bus since the MPDP becomes the avionics mux bus controller in this
situation. Transfer of the same information (listed above) now takes place
between the AIU set and MPDP.

Air Data Computer (ADC) or Air Data Processor (ADP)

Description

The ADC is a digital computer that converts analog data input into a
digital output format. The ADC will be replaced by the ADP after
TCTO 1F-15E-737. This change should be transparent to the operator.

Function

The ADC/ADP receives input from system sources shown on the left side
of Figure D-5, corrects these errors for installation error, computes and
provides required data to aircraft equipment and cockpit displays shown
on the right side of Figure D-5. It also performs data validity checks and
sets off appropriate cautions and warnings.

Operation

ADC/ADP system operation is automatic with no in-flight control
available. The ADC/ADP receives power as long as one main generator is
on-line. The FCP standby altimeter BARO SET knob is the only control
provided for changing the aircraft barometric altimeter setting.

Attitude Heading Reference Set (AHRS)

Description

The AHRS is a gyromagnetic compass system that is composed of:

Directional gyro (DG)

Magnetic azimuth detector (MAD)
Electronic control amplifier (ECA)
Compass control panel (CCP)

Installing GPS hardware (via TCTO 1F-15E-737) will result in removal of
the AHRS. The functions of the AHRS will be replaced by a system called
the EGI-INS or simply EGI. The EGI consists of a single hardware box
containing both a GPS receiver and processor and a second independent
aircraft ring laser gyro INS. The previous aircraft INS becomes (for
terminology) the fighter navigation unit INS (FNU-INS). Both the
FNU-INS and the EGI are covered in detail in a follow-on Avionics lesson.

Function

The magnetic azimuth detector (MAD) provides magnetic heading during
initial INS alignment. The AHRS provides magnetic heading to various
avionic systems and attitude backup in the event of INS failure (or if
AHRS is aircrew-selected as the aircraft attitude source from the ADI
display format).

AVI-1 D-16


Text from AVI-1_Avionics_Introduction_page_23.jpeg:
Operation

The AHRS interfaces with the CC to provide heading and attitude backup
when the CC determines that INS data is invalid. It receives power as
long as one main generator is on-line.

The AHRS is controlled via the compass control panel (CCP) (Figure D-6).

AVI-01-06

Figure D - 6. AHRS CCP.

The CCP Controls Are:

Mode Selector Knob

COMP

DG

This mode is usually selected only when there is a
gyro malfunction. The heading is sensed from the
MAD and passed to other aircraft systems. The
AHRS acts the same as a standby compass and is
reliable only in straight and level flight.

The heading is sensed from the DG. The DG mode is
used in latitudes higher than 70° (or where the earth
magnetic field is distorted). When first selected, the
magnetic heading must be set into the system with
the PUSH TO SYNC knob. DG is also used during
MAD failure to stabilize heading.

AVI-1

This is the normal setting. The heading is sensed
from the DG and is continuously corrected by the
MAD and passed to other systems.

This is a combination push-to-sync and push-to-turn
(set heading) knob. Two situations apply:

Depress the knob to allow the AHRS to provide fast
synchronization of the DG magnetic heading output
to the MAD.

With AHRS selected on the ADI, depress and rotate
the knob to slew the AHRS heading on the HSI
compass card. The HUD heading readout will not be
affected, unless there is a failure in the INS heading.

With the mode selector in the SLAVED position, this
meter indicates the difference (plus or minus)
between the DG and the MAD headings.

With AHRS selected on the ADI, to correct an
obvious disagreement between the ADI and the
visually confirmed aircraft attitude, depress the
button to re-erect the AHRS gyro. Maintain wings
level, one G flight until the process is complete. The
AHRS will indicate invalid BIT outputs during the
fast erect process.

Set switch to your current hemisphere.
Set to present position latitude. In the DG and

SLAVED modes, the AHRS determines the correction
required for gyro drift due to the earth's rotation.

AVIONIC SYSTEM ORIENTATION

The avionic system is designed around a software driven central computer
(CC) which provides control and integration of the various aircraft avionic
components (hardware and software). The CC utilizes the avionics
systems and subsystems effectively as ONE weapon system. This design
concept, together with the design of the missionized cockpits, constitutes a
major change over previous fighter aircraft.

On earlier aircraft, avionic systems were “hardwired” to cockpit control
panels and each system’s information was displayed on independent dials
and gauges. This resulted in crowded cockpits and instrument panels.

When computers were initially included in avionic systems, some system
integration was made possible; however, control was still managed
through hardwired control panels. Use of the inertial navigation system
(INS) for computed weapons release is an example of initial system
integration. Other systems such as TACAN, UHF radio, IFF, radar, etc.,
operated independently of each other.

As the evolution of avionics continued, more systems either were
internally designed with computer capabilities or were designed to receive
information from other systems. The increased computer capability
required the creation of operational flight programs (OFPs). The added
increase in overall avionic system integration required the creation of
common communication channels (mux buses). Command and control of
such a powerful, complex avionic system required the creation of a
common, single-source component that could be programmed to manage
the entire system effectively, hence, the central computer.

The F-15E central computer allows for a high degree of avionic system
integration as it accepts inputs and provides data for most onboard
systems. A multipurpose display system eliminates the need for
individual scopes, dials and gauges. The upfront control (UFC) replaces
most cockpit control panels. The system OFPs are designed to reduce
aircrew workload and allow for flexibility in the operation of aircraft
systems.

The avionic systems include all communication, control, nav aids, displays
and sensors. Control of most systems is available from either cockpit.

Avionic System OFPs

OFPs are the “software” or tapes that drive the avionic system’s
“hardware” or black boxes. There are 16 OFPs in the F-15E; the
breakdown is as follows:

Central computer (CC)-1

Multipurpose display processor (MPDP)-2

Avionics interface unit (AIU) set-3

Flight control computer (FCC)-2

Inertial navigation set (INS)-1

Programmable armament control system (PACS)-1

Radar-1

Radar warning receiver (RWR)-1

Internal countermeasures set (ICS)—1

Countermeasure dispenser (CMD)-1

LANTIRN navigation pod—1 (plus an additional OFP for the F-16)
LANTIRN targeting pod—1 (plus an additional OFP for the F-16)

Computer Talk

You have already been bombarded with terms and acronyms that may
have meant nothing to you up to now. But it is important that you
understand what a few of them mean before continuing this lesson,
because you will hear and use these terms daily. Remember that on all
flights you will be manipulating many systems (hardware) that have their
own OFP tapes (software) and computer sections. If you were not
computer literate before, you will be soon!

Interface is how the aircrew “talks” to systems for power on/off, changing
channels, setting frequencies, etc. It does not reflect system status, i.e.,
you can lose interface with an avionic system that is still operating
normally. What this usually means is that you will still be able to use the
system on whatever channel/frequency/mode that was selected when
interface was lost.

Nonvolatile Memory (NVM) is permanent memory space. Data placed
here is retained even when the power source is no longer available (like at
engine shutdown). Like any other computer, the CC has program
commands that are executed when power is applied to “set it up” for
normal operations.

Random Access Memory (RAM) is transient or “volatile” memory space.
Data placed here is lost when the power source is no longer available. In
any computer, RAM is the “working space” available for manipulating
data for programs. Once the data is sent elsewhere or no longer needed,
this space is “wiped clean” so that it will be available again for other
programs.

Multiplex (Mux) Buses are essentially the connections between the CC
and the various avionics systems that allow multiple electronic signals to
be transmitted along multiple paths and directions. The most common
signals used are called “words” and can be either command, status or data
words.

Mux Bus Failures are faults that are stored and can be viewed by the
aircrew in the CC NVM when a mux bus has failed a CC-initiated mux
test. Because of the complexity, integration and the large amount of
communication between the CC and other avionics systems, it is
necessary that the CC ensure that the mux bus channels stay in
synchronization and pass valid signals. The CC monitors the status of the
mux buses by sending out a “test select word” every second to every
avionic component on each mux bus. The mux bus failure data can be
cleared from the CC NVM by the aircrew. This procedure is in the built-in
test (BIT) lesson.

Bus Controller is an avionic system component that is programmed to be
“in control” of one or more mux buses and their operations. Being a bus
controller is the equivalent to being the “master terminal” in a computer
network setup, with the rest of the avionic system components being
“remote terminals” or “peripherals.”
