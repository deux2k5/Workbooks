LCD Brightness Control

A brightness control knob (Figure D-3) provides a full range of LCD
lighting adjustment for night use. Since LCD is a reflective type display,
backlighting is not required for day operation.

Keyboard

The keyboard (Figure D-3) is arranged in a standard telephone style
matrix with an egg crate barrier between the keys to minimize
inadvertent selection. For keys which are labeled with two characters or
functions, access the top letter or function by first pressing and releasing
the shift (SHF) key, then the desired key.

Keyboard lighting is controlled by the UFC knob on the interior lights
control panel on the right console in each cockpit.

Option Push Buttons (PBs)

The ten buttons allow data entry, power control, submenu access and
function selection. For reference, the buttons are numbered 1 through 10
counterclockwise, starting from the top left.

Data Entry: Pressing the appropriate button transfers data from the
scratchpad into the desired system. In some cases, if a system is off or
deactivated, it is simultaneously turned on/activated by the entry of
scratchpad data (LAW, TCN, IFF, AAI, ILS).

Power Control: Pressing the appropriate button turns the power on or off
to various systems. OFF follows the system legend if the system is
off/deactivated (Figure D-4, Left). System parameters follow the system
legend if the system is on/activated (Figure D-4, Right).

Submenu Access: With a clear scratchpad, pressing an option push button
calls up a submenu, where applicable.

Function Control: With a clear scratchpad, pressing an appropriate
system button selects or deselects a system function. Asterisks, as shown
in Figure D-4, indicate selection of modes or options.

Emission Limit Button

When pressed, the EMIS LMT button (Figure D-6, top) stops all RF
transmissions from the aircraft (except for the radar altimeter and terrain
following radar). A caution/advisory light (Figure D-6, bottom) also
illuminates in both cockpits to alert the crew that the function has been
selected. When the button is pushed again, the EMIS LMT light is
extinguished and all affected systems are returned to their previously
selected state of operation. Either crew member can select or deselect this
function on the UFC.

Operation of the UFC

Operation of the UFC requires use of the keyboard, scratchpad and option
push buttons. Each crew member can access any UFC format without
affecting the UFC display format in the other cockpit. Each crew member
can use the UFC independently of the other crew member.

D-7 AVI-3


Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_page_14.jpeg:
Scratchpad

The scratchpad is the 10 character-wide area on the bottom line of the
UFC display, between UHF 1 and 2 radio preset channel data. As you
type on the keyboard, the characters appear on the scratchpad. After
confirming the data displayed in the scratchpad, enter the data by
pressing the button next to the appropriate system legend on the LCD.

If the scratchpad entry is invalid (more keyboard entries are performed
than can be displayed in the scratchpad, or the format of entries is
inappropriate for the system you attempt to interface with) the scratchpad
flashes. To clear the incorrect data, press the CLR key once to stop the
flashing, and then press CLR again to clear the last digit. One more press
clears the entire scratchpad. If the scratchpad is not flashing, the first
press of the CLR key clears the last character entered; the second press
clears the entire scratchpad.

Keyboard

The following terms are used throughout this workbook to describe how
keys and buttons operate.

Action Operating Definitions
Press Press and release a key or button.

Cycle Press a key or button to “toggle” between two
options.

Step Press a key or button to move in sequence
through several options.

Table D - 1.

AVI-3 D-8


Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_page_15.jpeg:
On the UFC keyboard (Figure D-7), the alphanumeric keys allow entry of
numbers, upper case letters and symbols. For example:

A, B, C for route Alpha, Bravo (or Base Point or
Bullseye) and Charlie

N, 8, E, W for North, South, East and West

M for mark point selection

Do for decimal point, colon and dash
(Route and mark point selection will be covered in the INS lesson.)

AVI-03-07

Figure D - 7. UFC Keyboard.

The function keys surrounding the alphanumeric keys are used to provide
for selection, change and entry of various types of data.

GREC SHF and then GREC activates/deactivates the guard
receiver on the appropriate UHF radio. Separate
selections are provided for each UHF radio (left side UHF
1, right side UHF 2).

C/M key shifts between the preset channel and the manual
UHF frequency. Separate selections are provided for each
UHF radio (left side UHF 1, right side UHF 2). An
asterisk signifies which is currently selected, manual
frequency or preset channel.

MARK The MARK key inputs and stores the aircraft’s present
position latitude and longitude and the time of day the
mark was made. Up to ten mark points can be input and
stored for future reference.

D-9 AVI-3


Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_page_16.jpeg:
DECIMAL (.) The decimal is used when entering some types of
navigation points. Decimals can be used, but are not
required for numerical entries (UHF frequencies, ILS
frequencies, latitude/longitude coordinates, etc).

A/P The A/P key is used to engage the autopilot.

CLR The CLR key clears the scratchpad or the display
rows. Successive activation will (in turn) stop the
scratchpad from flashing, or clear the last character,
clear the scratchpad, blank the top four rows of the
LCD, and blank all rows of the LCD.

DATA The DATA key selects the Data 1 display or
alternately cycles between the two data displays
(DATA 1/DATA 2).

MENU The MENU key selects the Menu 1 display or

alternately cycles between the two menu displays
(MENU 1/MENU 2).

SHF To select the upper functions of the alphanumeric
keys, press SHF before pressing the desired key. The
system then automatically returns to lower case
alphanumerics; therefore, pressing the keys SHF, A,
1, 2, 3, will produce A, 1, 2, 3 not A, A, N, B.

I/P Initiates IFF identification of present position (IFF
IDENT POSITION).
FCP/RCP Integration

If both crew members access the same system, the last input from either
UFC provides the controlling data input; otherwise, all data entries of one
UFC are independent of the other UFC. Data being keyed into one UFC
scratchpad is repeated on the other UFC scratchpad if that scratchpad is
clear. (Repeated data cannot be entered; that is, scratchpad data can only
be entered from the UFC on which it was keyed). As soon as you start to
key data, any previous information on the scratchpad keyed from the
other cockpit clears automatically. You can also clear repeated data from
your scratchpad with the CLR key.

UFC Displays
The display formats which allow crew members to access the various UFC
controlled systems are referred to as data displays, menus and submenus.

There are some 25 submenus. The two data displays and two menu
displays can be selected with or without data in the scratchpad.

AVI-3 D-12


Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_page_19.jpeg:
Menus: There are two menus. On power up, the UFC display initializes
to Menu 1. Pressing the MENU key cycles between Menu 1 and Menu 2
(Figure D-9). Pressing the MENU key from any other format calls up
Menu 1.

Submenus: Menus 1 and 2 provide access to submenus that allow
selection of specific system functions. Submenus can only be selected if
the scratchpad is blank.

There are submenus for UHF 1, UHF 2, TACAN, IFF, NAV FLIR (N-F),
AAT, Autopilot (A/P), present position (PP) keeping source, position
updates (UPDT MENU), and in some instances, submenus for the above

UHF RADIOS

The UHF system consists of two separate receivers and transmitters
(UHF 1 and UHF 2) which operate on manually selected and preset
frequencies within the 225.000 to 399.975 MHZ frequency range.

Each UHF radio has a guard (243.0) receiver that can be activated
through the UFC when the radio is operating.

Both UHF radios have provisions for anti-jam communications (HAVE
QUICK) and secure communications (KY-58). These capabilities will be
addressed in more detail in a subsequent academic lesson.

The UHF radios are operated by controls located on the:

Remote intercommunication control panel (RICP)—FCP only
Intercommunication set control panel (ICSCP)—RCP only
Throttles

Floor buttons—RCP only

The FCP RICP has two additional switches not found on the RCP ICSCP:
e The VHF antenna selector switch is presently inoperative.

e The UHF antenna selector switch allows the pilot to select the
upper or lower antenna for the UHF 1 radio. The AUTO position
causes the UHF 1 radio to automatically select the antenna with
the best signal. The UHF 2 always transmits and receives on the
lower antenna.

Throttles

A three-position microphone switch is located on the inboard throttle in
each cockpit for UHF transmissions (Figure D-14). Pushing the switch
forward allows you to transmit on UHF 1; pulling the switch aft allows
you to transmit on UHF 2. The switch is spring loaded to the center

UHF POWER UP

After power is applied to the aircraft (first generator on-line), the UFC
displays Menu 1. UHF 1 frequency information is located on the left two
bottom lines of the UFC, UHF 2 is on the right side. “OFF” is displayed at
PB #5/PB 46 if the respective radio is off. In Figure D-16, left, UHF 1 and
UHF 2 are turned off. In Figure D-16 (bottom), UHF 1 is turned on and
set to preset channel 2, as signified by the asterisk on the bottom line of
the UFC (and the asterisk at PB #1 on the UHF 1 submenu).

AVI-3 D - 24


Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_page_31.jpeg:
There are five ways to apply power to a UHF radio.

The first way is to press PB #5 (PB #6) (with the scratchpad clear) to
bring up the UHF 1 (UHF 2) submenu (Figure D-16, right). The
absence of an asterisk (*) adjacent to U1 (U2) on the submenu [and
“U1 OFF” (“U2 OFF”) next to PB #5 (PB #6) on all UFC formats]
signifies that the UHF 1 (UHF 2) radio is off. Pressing PB #1 (still
with a blank scratchpad) applies power to the appropriate UHF radio
and displays the asterisk symbol showing that the radio is on. The
last entered manual frequency appears at PB #5 (PB #6) and an
asterisk appears adjacent to the last selected frequency type (i.e.,
manual or preset), as shown in Figure D-16, bottom. The same
procedure is used to turn on UHF 2 using PB #6 on MENU 1 to
display the UHF 2 submenu. The UHF 1 and UHF 2 submenus are
identical except for PB #1 (U1 or U2) and UHF 2 submenu does not
display ADF at PB #2.

A second way to apply power to a UHF radio is to enter a valid
channel number in the scratchpad and press the appropriate channel
select knob. The radio comes on and tunes to the selected channel.

A third way to apply power to a UHF radio is to enter a valid manual
frequency in the scratchpad and press PB #5 (UHF 1) or PB #6 (UHF
2). The radio comes on and tunes to the selected manual frequency.

A fourth way to apply power to a UHF radio is to turn the
appropriate channel select knob. This turns the radio on, selects
channel mode and increments the channel number.

A fifth way to apply power to a UHF radio is to press the appropriate
channel select knob with an empty scratchpad. The radio comes on
and tunes to the previously selected preset channel.

The only way to turn a radio off is to select the appropriate UHF
submenu and press PB #1. This removes power from the radio, the
asterisk from PB #1 and the selected frequency type. “OFF” appears
at PB #5/PB #6, as appropriate.

Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_page_32.jpeg:
Manual/Preset Frequency Selection

Refer to the left display example in Figure D-17, which depicts preset
channel 2 selected on UHF 1. To select the manual frequency, 226.125,
press the left C/M (channel/manual) key. The asterisk moves to the
manual frequency (Figure D-17, right).

To return to the UHF 1 preset frequency, press the left C/M key again.
The asterisk moves to the preset channel. The same logic applies to UHF
2, except the right C/M key is used.

To activate the guard receiver, first press the SHF key and then press the
appropriate GREC key (Figure D-18). The letter “G” appears next to the
manual frequency readout (in this case UHF 2) indicating the guard
receiver is active. To activate the guard receiver on UHF 1, use the same
procedures, but use the left GREC key. To deactivate the guard receiver,
press SHF and then the appropriate GREC key. The “G” goes away.

Selecting Guard to Transmit/Receive

To transmit on guard frequency, select the guard preset on either UHF 1
or UHF 2 by rotating the appropriate UHF radio preset channel selector
until the letter “G” appears next to the channel selector (Figure D-19).

With “G” selected for more than one second, the C/M asterisk
automatically transfers next to the G if not already there.

(Optionally, the guard frequency, 2438.0, can be entered into either UHF
radio as a manual frequency. See “Entering a Manual Frequency.”)

Entering a Manual Frequency

To select a specific manual frequency (for example, 314.65 on UHF 1),
press the desired numeric keys so that the new frequency is displayed in
the scratchpad and then press PB #5 (Figure D-20). To change the UHF 2
manual frequency you would press PB #6. The decimal point and trailing
zeros may, but need not be keyed. Inputting a manual frequency also
turns the radio on.

Use of Decimal and Colons

Generally, entries which have a fixed number of digits (fixed field) do not
require the entry of decimals or colons. An example of a fixed field is the
UHF radio frequency, which always requires three nondecimal digits. In
this case, the decimal need not be entered; the UFC automatically
displays the decimal between the third and the fourth digit when the
scratchpad entry is identified as a radio frequency (i.e., when PB #5 or
PB 46 is pressed).

Time may be entered without entering the colon and is assumed to have
two hour digits (thus, when entering time, leading zeros are required).
Trailing zeros are automatically added to the field. Examples of how
entries are made are shown in the following:

FIELD FORMAT UFC ENTRY UFC DISPLAY

Time XX:XX:XX 1 10:00:00

UHF Submenu

The UHF 1 and UHF 2 submenus are accessed by pressing PB #5 (UHF 1)
or PB #6 (UHF 2) with an empty scratchpad. These submenus allow:

Turning radios on/off,
Programming the UHF preset frequencies (channels),
Selection of the ADF function (UHF 1 only),
Selection of the HAVE QUICK (anti-jam) and KY-58 (secure voice)
functions, and
e Selection of Both Transmit (Both TX).
Programming a UHF Preset Frequency (Channel)

Select the desired UHF submenu. In our example, PB #6 calls up the
UHF 2 submenu. Note that the current preset channel (10) appears at PB
#1 and its frequency (229.000) appears at PB #10. To change this
frequency to 314.65, enter 31465 in the scratchpad (Figure D-21). Press
PB #10, and the new frequency (314.65) for preset channel 10 is displayed.
When initially entering the UHF submenu the current preset frequency is
displayed next to PB #1. To change the frequency of another channel,
type the channel number into the scratchpad and enter it at PB #1. The

transmitting channel has not been changed. This allows all other preset
channels to be changed while still monitoring the desired/assigned

Both TX (Both Transmit)

The capability exists to simultaneously transmit on two separate
frequencies. By selecting BOTH TX (PB #7) on either the UHF 1 or UHF
2 submenu, whenever transmission is attempted (with mic switch either
forward or aft, or RCP foot pedals), both radios transmit. This has certain
electronic protection (EP) benefits but can also cause embarrassment if
unknowingly selected. If BOTH TX is selected on either radio, an asterisk
appears next to PB #7 on both UHF submenus, indicating activation.

This should be checked during preflight ground ops. To deactivate, press
PB #7 (with a blank scratchpad). The asterisk disappears indicating
deactivation.

NAVIGATION EQUIPMENT
TACAN

The TACAN provides precise air-to-ground bearing and range information
to a maximum distance of approximately 300 miles (depending upon
aircraft altitude). It can also be operated in an air-to-air mode with
aircraft having similar equipment and provides line of sight distance
between two aircraft operating their TACAN sets 63 channels apart. Up
to five aircraft can determine their range from a sixth aircraft if their
TACAN sets are set 63 channels apart from that aircraft. Range is
limited to four times the distance between the lead aircraft and the
nearest aircraft. The sixth aircraft will be provided range from one of the
other aircraft, but cannot readily determine from which aircraft. A/A
TACAN information is normally limited to DME only; however, some
aircraft, such as the KC-10, can provide bearing also.

IFF/AAI SYSTEM

The F-15E IFF/AAT system directly interfaces with the UFC and includes
the IFF/SIF and air-to-air identification (AAI).

IFF

The identification system provides automatic identification when
challenged by a surface or airborne interrogator, as well as momentary
identification of aircraft position upon request. The IFF modes provided
are:

Mode 1 Mode 3 Mode C
Mode 2 Mode 4 A/B

Mode 4 is used for highest confidence identification (crypto), and Mode C
is used for altitude reporting.

Modes 1, 2, 3 and C are selected/deselected from the UFC. Mode 1 and
Mode 8 codes can be input from the UFC; Mode 2 codes are set from the
IFF transponder control box located in the aircraft nose (door 3R) and
cannot be altered in flight. Mode 4 is keyed by maintenance personnel.
Mode 4 controls are located on the RICP (FCP, left console) and the ICSCP
(RCP, left console).

scratchpad entry; and press the IFF button). The entered mode and code
are displayed next to the IFF button for five seconds. The legend then
reverts to displaying the activated modes. The Mode 2 IFF code cannot be
changed from the cockpit. The Mode 4 codes (A or B) can only be selected
with the Mode 4 selector switch in the front cockpit. Mode 1 code entries
are limited to 0-7 for the first digit and 0-3 for the second digit; so the
lowest code is 00 and the highest is 73. Mode 3 code entries are limited to
0-7 for all digits; so the lowest valid code is 0000 and the highest is 7777.

The IFF submenu is selected by pressing the IFF button with a clear
scratchpad. The submenu allows access to the various functions (modes,
codes and programming) of IFF Modes 1, 2, 3 and C (Figure D-39). Mode
4 information is never displayed on the IFF submenu. Mode 4 control can
only be accomplished through the FCP RICP on the left console (Mode 4
selector switch—A, B or OUT).

Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_page_64.jpeg:
The IFF program submenu is used to program specific IFF modes and
codes to change as a function of time, which is referred to as “phasing”
(PH). Up to 18 different phases can be programmed. Only Modes 1, 2, 3
and C can be phased. Mode 4 must be changed manually on the FCP
RICP. Once activated, phasing is based on the CC/GPS clock time. As the
time passes the phase start time, the programmed modes and codes are
activated or deactivated automatically. Phasing is normally programmed
by the data transfer module (DTM); however, it can be manually
programmed or changed in the aircraft.

To enter the IFF phase programming submenu, press the PROGRAM
button. The asterisk adjacent to PROGRAM indicates that you are in the
IFF phase programming submenu. If IFF phases have been entered
either manually or by the DTM, a phase number appears next to PH at
PB #1. The selected modes, codes and time programmed for phase
number 1 are shown in Figure D-42, right.

AAI

The aircraft’s Air-to-Air Interrogator (AAI) set provides A/A target
identification capabilities to assist the aircrew in accomplishing a variety
of tasks. The following discussion addresses AAI and Enhanced
Identification (EID) in only a basic fashion. A detailed discussion will be
addressed in a follow-on lesson in the air-to-air radar block of instruction.
The capabilities can be used to assist in:

e finding aircraft on the air-to-air radar.

e determining on the radar, which friendly aircraft is which.

e determining on the radar if an aircraft is friendly or hostile [based
on predetermined Rules of Engagement (ROE)/Positive
Identification (PID) criteria].

The interrogator set transmits challenge signals and receives target IFF
replies through the L-band antennas mounted on the main radar antenna.
The system evaluates the replies and generates display symbols
(diamonds or circles) on the A/A radar display (or the A/G radar display)
at the correct target range and azimuth position.

The UFC, in conjunction with HOTAS activation, provides the
mechanisms for controlling/implementing the interrogation. The radar
(both A/A and A/G) provides us information concerning the progress and
results of our interrogation. AAI interrogation can be interfaced from
UFC Menu 1 or from the AAI or EID UFC submenus.

The aircrew can make UFC selections, which determine how the AAI
interrogation will be implemented. Any combinations of Modes 1, 2, 3 and
4 can be interrogated with a single HOTAS switch action. Modes 1
through 3 can be interrogated such that replies to the mode (regardless of
code) are displayed (normal mode) or such that the interrogated
transponder must reply with both the correct mode and the correct code
(correct code mode). Mode 4 AAI always functions in the correct code
mode, with the code being A, B or both A and B.

UPFRONT CONTROL COMPONENT DESCRIPTION AND
FUNCTION

The upfront control (UFC) is the primary interface between the aircrew
and numerous aircraft avionics. It is powered up on engine start when
the first main generator comes on-line and remains operating as long as
either a main generator or the emergency generator (in AUTO or
MANUAL) is on-line.

Use of the UFC is integral to the operation of the aircraft equipment and
allows crew members to control the following systems:

UHF radios—including automatic direction finding (ADF), HAVE
QUICK (anti-jam feature) and KY-58 (secure voice feature)
functions

Inertial navigation system (INS) (most functions, including
present position coordinate entry and navigation point
entry/selection)

TACAN

ILS (instrument landing system)

NAV FLIR (navigation forward looking infrared)

IFF/SIF (identification friend or foe/selective identification
feature)

AAI (air-to-air interrogator) and EID (enhanced identification)
A/P (autopilot)

LAWS (low altitude warning system)

GCWS (ground collision warning system)

The above list is not all-inclusive. Other capabilities controlled through
the UFC will be covered in subsequent academic lessons.

AAI Submenu

The AAI submenu is accessed from UFC Menu 1, PB #8 (Figure D-46,
left). On the AAI submenu (Figure D-46, right), Modes 1 through 3 can be
activated and their respective codes can be entered in exactly the same
manner as the IFF. As with the IFF submenu, the asterisks indicate
which modes are selected for interrogation. The “N” or “C” following each
mode identifies which master mode is selected for each mode. The “N” or
“C” can be changed from either Menu 1 or the AAI submenu utilizing the
scratchpad. The “N” or “C” can be entered separately (AAI submenu) or in
conjunction with a mode or mode/code change (from Menu 1), or in
conjunction with a code change from the AAI submenu. The “N” indicates
that correct mode replies will be shown on the radar. The “C” indicates
that only replies with the correct code will be shown on the radar for that
mode.

Additionally the legend will read AUTO ID-EID if
the AUTO feature is selected on the EID submenu.
STT, PDT, will be discussed again in later lessons.
For now, in simple terms, with AUTO ID, STT or
PDT selected, the system will automatically start
an AAT interrogation sequence cycling through all
modes selected on the AAI (or EID) submenu, when
the radar enters track on a target and that target
does not already have an AAI-ID associated with it
(from a previous interrogation). The sequence

would result from a manual interrogation (via

HOTAS).

Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_page_72.jpeg:
HOTAS

Activate an AAI interrogation sequence (defined by the asterisked modes
on the UFC) with pilot coolie switch outboard for greater than 1 second or
RCP right hand control (RHC) AAI switch forward for greater than 1
second. The switch action locks in the sequence for the selected modes,
each for the selected number of bars. Either crew member can stop their
own initiated sequence with a second switch activation for greater than 1
second. The pilot cannot stop a RCP initiated sequence, or vice versa.

Interrogation

The legend in the lower left corner (Figure D-47) of the A/A radar cycles
through each selected mode/master mode (AAI 1N, AAT 2C, AAT 3N, etc.)
as each is interrogated. Diamonds (Modes 1, 2 and 3 reply or low
confidence Mode 4 reply) or circles (high confidence Mode 4 reply) are
displayed at the correct azimuth and range on the radar. At PB #8
(AAT/EID) on the UFC Menu 1, the modes, codes and master modes (C or
N) will cycle through as they are interrogated. Once the interrogation is
complete both the radar and UFC Menu 1 return to normal format.

The EID submenu allows AAI selections totally independent of the AAI

changes to the EID selections cannot be implemented from UFC Menu 1.
The legends on UFC Menu 1 showing selected modes and showing the
progress of an interrogation, as well as the A/A radar cues showing the
progress/results of an interrogation are the same as for AAI, except
information is prefaced by “EID” vice “AAI.” The HOTAS switchology is
the same, except the FCP coolie is moved inboard (vice outboard for AAT)
and the RCP interrogate switch is moved aft (vice forward for AAI). The
significance of PB #8 (“MX 2”) will be addressed at a later time.

D - 67 AVI-3


Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_page_74.jpeg:
Obviously, the capability to program two separate interrogation sequences
on the AAI/EID submenus provides a great deal of flexibility. The
optimum way to use the capability is totally situation dependent. Another
lesson, in the A/A radar block of instruction, will further address AAI/EID.
For now, consider the following examples.

AVI-3

You are flying night trail formation beyond visual range of your
leader. You have programmed the AAI submenu to interrogate
your leader’s discrete Mode 1 code (M1-11C) and the EID submenu
to interrogate for VFR traffic (M3-1200C).

You are flying a combat mission escorting a strike package. You
have programmed the AAI submenu to interrogate the strike
package’s discrete mode (M2-7777C) and the EID submenu to fulfill
the ROE to discriminate enemy aircraft—absence of Mode 4A and
absence of Mode 1 (M4A and M1-11N).

You are flying a low level training mission, and for see-and-avoid
you want to interrogate for both VFR civilian traffic (M3-1200) and
VFR military special use airspace traffic (M3-4000). You program
M8-1200C on the AAI submenu and M38-4000C on the AAT
submenu. You use correct code because you do not want to see
replies from IFR traffic squawking Mode 3.

Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_page_81.jpeg:
Warning Indications

In flight, if the actual aircraft AGL altitude goes below the LAWS
altitude, the LOW ALT warning lights and voice warning are activated.
The LAWS warnings are independent of the TF system. If the LAWS is
enabled on the ground, the LAWS does not provide the visual or aural
warnings until the aircraft climbs above the LAWS value and then
descends back down through the LAWS altitude. The LAWS warnings
also activate if the LAWS is enabled and the radar altimeter fails or if it
breaks track with aircraft parameters below 5000 feet (AGL), <60° roll
and <60° pitch.

The LAWS warnings (lights and voice) terminate if:
e The aircraft climbs at least 20 feet above the LAWS altitude.
e The LAWS function is turned off via the UFC.

e The LAWS altitude is changed to a value below the present aircraft
AGL altitude.

Ground Collision Warning System (GCWS)

The central computer (CC) utilizes aircraft inputs to provide visual and
aural warnings of a controlled flight into terrain (CFIT). It is a passive
system in that it provides no automatic recovery. Not all impending
CFITs produce a GCWS warning.

The CC uses inputs from the INS, ADC, FCC, ATUs, radar altimeter and
PACS to compute the altitude (AGL) to initiate the warnings. If OWOFF
or INVARM (stores identified on the PACS does not match aircraft-sensed
stores aboard) is displayed on the HUD, the GCWS is inoperative.

GCWS modes are aircrew selectable through UFC Menu 2 (Figure D-54).

Enter the time via the keyboard. For the time 0730, type 0, 7, 3, in the
scratchpad, and press PB #8. Colons and trailing zeros do not have to be
used; leading zeros are required.

The CC clock time is used for command speeds to achieve TOTs, IFF
phasing and ETAs. The CC battery keeps the time running with electrical
power removed from the aircraft. The CC time reads OFF at aircraft
start. Anytime power is interrupted to the CC, TIME OFF is displayed at
PB #8. Assuming a good CC battery, simply pressing PB #8 redisplays the
current time. Command speeds, IFF phasing and ETAs are only as
accurate as the CC clock time. Command speed, IFF phasing and ETA
computations will not be provided with CC clock time OFF.

Setting the Time of Day (after GPS)

With GPS, the aircrew can choose among totally GPS time, totally CC
clock time or a partial CC clock time that is completed by GPS. Total GPS
time is always ZULU; the aircrew can choose to use local hours with the
minutes/seconds filled in with GPS sourced time. With weight-on-wheels,
power up will initialize the clock to GPS time, if GPS time is valid. If GPS
time is invalid, the clock will initialize to CC clock time. If GPS time

becomes valid, after power up, with weight-on-wheels and the aircrew has
not made a time input, the time will reset to GPS time.

The aircrew can use PB #8 to make partial time entries that will be
completed with GPS time (if GPS time is valid). The aircrew can also use
a complete time entry (hours, minutes, seconds), so that GPS time is
totally excluded. Lastly, by pressing PB #8 with a blank scratchpad, the
aircrew can reselect total GPS time (if valid) over CC time. Table D-2
summarizes the aircraft time of day mechanization.
