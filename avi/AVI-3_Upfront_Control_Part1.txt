LCD Brightness Control

A brightness control knob (Figure D-3) provides a full range of LCD
lighting adjustment for night use. Since LCD is a reflective type display,
backlighting is not required for day operation.

Keyboard

The keyboard (Figure D-3) is arranged in a standard telephone style
matrix with an egg crate barrier between the keys to minimize
inadvertent selection. For keys which are labeled with two characters or
functions, access the top letter or function by first pressing and releasing
the shift (SHF) key, then the desired key.

Keyboard lighting is controlled by the UFC knob on the interior lights
control panel on the right console in each cockpit.

Option Push Buttons (PBs)

The ten buttons allow data entry, power control, submenu access and
function selection. For reference, the buttons are numbered 1 through 10
counterclockwise, starting from the top left.

Data Entry: Pressing the appropriate button transfers data from the
scratchpad into the desired system. In some cases, if a system is off or
deactivated, it is simultaneously turned on/activated by the entry of
scratchpad data (LAW, TCN, IFF, AAI, ILS).

Power Control: Pressing the appropriate button turns the power on or off
to various systems. OFF follows the system legend if the system is
off/deactivated (Figure D-4, Left). System parameters follow the system
legend if the system is on/activated (Figure D-4, Right).

Submenu Access: With a clear scratchpad, pressing an option push button
calls up a submenu, where applicable.

Function Control: With a clear scratchpad, pressing an appropriate
system button selects or deselects a system function. Asterisks, as shown
in Figure D-4, indicate selection of modes or options.

UHF/Preset Channel Selector Knobs

UHF 1 and 2 are the only radios installed in the aircraft at this time. The
UHF 1 preset channel selector knob is on the left and the UHF 2 preset
channel selector knob is on the right (Figure D-5). These UHF channel
selectors incorporate a spring loaded push position that will be used to
select two additional communication systems to be added in the future,
radio 3 (R38) and radio 4 (R4). There is currently no way to select radio 4.
Pushing in on the radio 2/4 channel selector knob will turn radio 2 on.
Pushing in on the radio 1/3 channel selector knob will turn radio 1 on. If
radio 1 is already on, alternate depressions select radio 1 or 3. If the
legend at PB #5 is “JVC,” push the UHF 1/3 channel selector knob to
select UHF (vice JTIDS, which will be installed in radio 3).

With power removed from UHF 1 or UHF 2 (OFF), turning the
appropriate channel select knob powers the corresponding radio on and
selects the preset channel (vice manual) operating mode. Turning the
preset channel knob increments the channel (1-20, G).

UHF Volume Controls

As shown in Figure D-5, the volume control for UHF 1 (inner knob) is
located on the left side of the UFC and is labeled R1 (radio 1). The volume
control for UHF 2 (inner knob) is located on the right side of the UFC and
is labeled R2. R3 and R4 volume controls (the larger/outer knobs) are not
functional at this time.

Emission Limit Button

When pressed, the EMIS LMT button (Figure D-6, top) stops all RF
transmissions from the aircraft (except for the radar altimeter and terrain
following radar). A caution/advisory light (Figure D-6, bottom) also
illuminates in both cockpits to alert the crew that the function has been
selected. When the button is pushed again, the EMIS LMT light is
extinguished and all affected systems are returned to their previously
selected state of operation. Either crew member can select or deselect this
function on the UFC.

Operation of the UFC

Operation of the UFC requires use of the keyboard, scratchpad and option
push buttons. Each crew member can access any UFC format without
affecting the UFC display format in the other cockpit. Each crew member
can use the UFC independently of the other crew member.

Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_Part1_page_14.jpeg:
Scratchpad

The scratchpad is the 10 character-wide area on the bottom line of the
UFC display, between UHF 1 and 2 radio preset channel data. As you
type on the keyboard, the characters appear on the scratchpad. After
confirming the data displayed in the scratchpad, enter the data by
pressing the button next to the appropriate system legend on the LCD.

If the scratchpad entry is invalid (more keyboard entries are performed
than can be displayed in the scratchpad, or the format of entries is
inappropriate for the system you attempt to interface with) the scratchpad
flashes. To clear the incorrect data, press the CLR key once to stop the
flashing, and then press CLR again to clear the last digit. One more press
clears the entire scratchpad. If the scratchpad is not flashing, the first
press of the CLR key clears the last character entered; the second press
clears the entire scratchpad.

Keyboard

The following terms are used throughout this workbook to describe how
keys and buttons operate.

Action Operating Definitions
Press Press and release a key or button.

Cycle Press a key or button to “toggle” between two
options.

Step Press a key or button to move in sequence
through several options.

AVI-3 D-8


Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_Part1_page_15.jpeg:
On the UFC keyboard (Figure D-7), the alphanumeric keys allow entry of
numbers, upper case letters and symbols. For example:

A, B, C for route Alpha, Bravo (or Base Point or
Bullseye) and Charlie

N, 8, E, W for North, South, East and West

M for mark point selection

Do for decimal point, colon and dash
(Route and mark point selection will be covered in the INS lesson.)

AVI-03-07

Figure D - 7. UFC Keyboard.

The function keys surrounding the alphanumeric keys are used to provide
for selection, change and entry of various types of data.

GREC SHF and then GREC activates/deactivates the guard
receiver on the appropriate UHF radio. Separate
selections are provided for each UHF radio (left side UHF
1, right side UHF 2).

C/M key shifts between the preset channel and the manual
UHF frequency. Separate selections are provided for each
UHF radio (left side UHF 1, right side UHF 2). An
asterisk signifies which is currently selected, manual
frequency or preset channel.

MARK The MARK key inputs and stores the aircraft’s present
position latitude and longitude and the time of day the
mark was made. Up to ten mark points can be input and
stored for future reference.

D-9 AVI-3


Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_Part1_page_16.jpeg:
DECIMAL (.) The decimal is used when entering some types of
navigation points. Decimals can be used, but are not
required for numerical entries (UHF frequencies, ILS
frequencies, latitude/longitude coordinates, etc).

A/P The A/P key is used to engage the autopilot.

CLR The CLR key clears the scratchpad or the display
rows. Successive activation will (in turn) stop the
scratchpad from flashing, or clear the last character,
clear the scratchpad, blank the top four rows of the
LCD, and blank all rows of the LCD.

DATA The DATA key selects the Data 1 display or
alternately cycles between the two data displays
(DATA 1/DATA 2).

MENU The MENU key selects the Menu 1 display or

alternately cycles between the two menu displays
(MENU 1/MENU 2).

SHF To select the upper functions of the alphanumeric
keys, press SHF before pressing the desired key. The
system then automatically returns to lower case
alphanumerics; therefore, pressing the keys SHF, A,
1, 2, 3, will produce A, 1, 2, 3 not A, A, N, B.

I/P Initiates IFF identification of present position (IFF
IDENT POSITION).
FCP/RCP Integration

If both crew members access the same system, the last input from either
UFC provides the controlling data input; otherwise, all data entries of one
UFC are independent of the other UFC. Data being keyed into one UFC
scratchpad is repeated on the other UFC scratchpad if that scratchpad is
clear. (Repeated data cannot be entered; that is, scratchpad data can only
be entered from the UFC on which it was keyed). As soon as you start to
key data, any previous information on the scratchpad keyed from the
other cockpit clears automatically. You can also clear repeated data from
your scratchpad with the CLR key.

UHF RADIOS

The UHF system consists of two separate receivers and transmitters
(UHF 1 and UHF 2) which operate on manually selected and preset
frequencies within the 225.000 to 399.975 MHZ frequency range.

Each UHF radio has a guard (243.0) receiver that can be activated
through the UFC when the radio is operating.

Both UHF radios have provisions for anti-jam communications (HAVE
QUICK) and secure communications (KY-58). These capabilities will be
addressed in more detail in a subsequent academic lesson.

The UHF radios are operated by controls located on the:

Remote intercommunication control panel (RICP)—FCP only
Intercommunication set control panel (ICSCP)—RCP only
Throttles

Floor buttons—RCP only

e The UHF antenna selector switch allows the pilot to select the
upper or lower antenna for the UHF 1 radio. The AUTO position
causes the UHF 1 radio to automatically select the antenna with
the best signal. The UHF 2 always transmits and receives on the
lower antenna.

Throttles

A three-position microphone switch is located on the inboard throttle in
each cockpit for UHF transmissions (Figure D-14). Pushing the switch
forward allows you to transmit on UHF 1; pulling the switch aft allows
you to transmit on UHF 2. The switch is spring loaded to the center

After power is applied to the aircraft (first generator on-line), the UFC
displays Menu 1. UHF 1 frequency information is located on the left two
bottom lines of the UFC, UHF 2 is on the right side. “OFF” is displayed at
PB #5/PB 46 if the respective radio is off. In Figure D-16, left, UHF 1 and
UHF 2 are turned off. In Figure D-16 (bottom), UHF 1 is turned on and
set to preset channel 2, as signified by the asterisk on the bottom line of

Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_Part1_page_31.jpeg:
There are five ways to apply power to a UHF radio.

The first way is to press PB #5 (PB #6) (with the scratchpad clear) to
bring up the UHF 1 (UHF 2) submenu (Figure D-16, right). The
absence of an asterisk (*) adjacent to U1 (U2) on the submenu [and
“U1 OFF” (“U2 OFF”) next to PB #5 (PB #6) on all UFC formats]
signifies that the UHF 1 (UHF 2) radio is off. Pressing PB #1 (still
with a blank scratchpad) applies power to the appropriate UHF radio
and displays the asterisk symbol showing that the radio is on. The
last entered manual frequency appears at PB #5 (PB #6) and an
asterisk appears adjacent to the last selected frequency type (i.e.,
manual or preset), as shown in Figure D-16, bottom. The same
procedure is used to turn on UHF 2 using PB #6 on MENU 1 to
display the UHF 2 submenu. The UHF 1 and UHF 2 submenus are
identical except for PB #1 (U1 or U2) and UHF 2 submenu does not
display ADF at PB #2.

A second way to apply power to a UHF radio is to enter a valid
channel number in the scratchpad and press the appropriate channel
select knob. The radio comes on and tunes to the selected channel.

A third way to apply power to a UHF radio is to enter a valid manual
frequency in the scratchpad and press PB #5 (UHF 1) or PB #6 (UHF
2). The radio comes on and tunes to the selected manual frequency.

A fourth way to apply power to a UHF radio is to turn the
appropriate channel select knob. This turns the radio on, selects
channel mode and increments the channel number.

A fifth way to apply power to a UHF radio is to press the appropriate
channel select knob with an empty scratchpad. The radio comes on
and tunes to the previously selected preset channel.

The only way to turn a radio off is to select the appropriate UHF
submenu and press PB #1. This removes power from the radio, the
asterisk from PB #1 and the selected frequency type. “OFF” appears
at PB #5/PB #6, as appropriate.

Manual/Preset Frequency Selection

Refer to the left display example in Figure D-17, which depicts preset
channel 2 selected on UHF 1. To select the manual frequency, 226.125,
press the left C/M (channel/manual) key. The asterisk moves to the
manual frequency (Figure D-17, right).

To return to the UHF 1 preset frequency, press the left C/M key again.
The asterisk moves to the preset channel. The same logic applies to UHF
2, except the right C/M key is used.

The new frequency appears in the manual frequency readout and the
previous frequency readout (226.125) moves to the scratchpad. This
makes it easy to return to the previous frequency by pressing PB #5 or #6
as appropriate. Once you enter a manual frequency at PB #5 or #6, a
single press of the CLR button clears the scratchpad frequency.

Use of Decimal and Colons

Generally, entries which have a fixed number of digits (fixed field) do not
require the entry of decimals or colons. An example of a fixed field is the
UHF radio frequency, which always requires three nondecimal digits. In
this case, the decimal need not be entered; the UFC automatically
displays the decimal between the third and the fourth digit when the
scratchpad entry is identified as a radio frequency (i.e., when PB #5 or
PB 46 is pressed).

Time may be entered without entering the colon and is assumed to have
two hour digits (thus, when entering time, leading zeros are required).
Trailing zeros are automatically added to the field. Examples of how
entries are made are shown in the following:

FIELD FORMAT UFC ENTRY UFC DISPLAY

Time XX:XX:XX 1 10:00:00

UHF Submenu

The UHF 1 and UHF 2 submenus are accessed by pressing PB #5 (UHF 1)
or PB #6 (UHF 2) with an empty scratchpad. These submenus allow:

Turning radios on/off,
Programming the UHF preset frequencies (channels),
Selection of the ADF function (UHF 1 only),
Selection of the HAVE QUICK (anti-jam) and KY-58 (secure voice)
functions, and
e Selection of Both Transmit (Both TX).
Programming a UHF Preset Frequency (Channel)

Select the desired UHF submenu. In our example, PB #6 calls up the
UHF 2 submenu. Note that the current preset channel (10) appears at PB
#1 and its frequency (229.000) appears at PB #10. To change this
frequency to 314.65, enter 31465 in the scratchpad (Figure D-21). Press
PB #10, and the new frequency (314.65) for preset channel 10 is displayed.
When initially entering the UHF submenu the current preset frequency is
displayed next to PB #1. To change the frequency of another channel,
type the channel number into the scratchpad and enter it at PB #1. The

new channel's manual frequency is displayed next to PB #10 and can be
changed the same way as mentioned before. Note that the receiving and
transmitting channel has not been changed. This allows all other preset
channels to be changed while still monitoring the desired/assigned
channel, or all channels to be changed while monitoring a manual
frequency. Preset frequencies can be entered through a data transfer
module (DTM) or mission cartridge (MC).

Both TX (Both Transmit)

The capability exists to simultaneously transmit on two separate
frequencies. By selecting BOTH TX (PB #7) on either the UHF 1 or UHF
2 submenu, whenever transmission is attempted (with mic switch either
forward or aft, or RCP foot pedals), both radios transmit. This has certain
electronic protection (EP) benefits but can also cause embarrassment if
unknowingly selected. If BOTH TX is selected on either radio, an asterisk
appears next to PB #7 on both UHF submenus, indicating activation.

This should be checked during preflight ground ops. To deactivate, press
PB #7 (with a blank scratchpad). The asterisk disappears indicating
deactivation.

NAVIGATION EQUIPMENT
TACAN

The TACAN provides precise air-to-ground bearing and range information
to a maximum distance of approximately 300 miles (depending upon
aircraft altitude). It can also be operated in an air-to-air mode with
aircraft having similar equipment and provides line of sight distance
between two aircraft operating their TACAN sets 63 channels apart. Up
to five aircraft can determine their range from a sixth aircraft if their
TACAN sets are set 63 channels apart from that aircraft. Range is
limited to four times the distance between the lead aircraft and the
nearest aircraft. The sixth aircraft will be provided range from one of the
other aircraft, but cannot readily determine from which aircraft. A/A
TACAN information is normally limited to DME only; however, some
aircraft, such as the KC-10, can provide bearing also.

IFF/AAI SYSTEM

The F-15E IFF/AAT system directly interfaces with the UFC and includes
the IFF/SIF and air-to-air identification (AAI).

IFF

The identification system provides automatic identification when
challenged by a surface or airborne interrogator, as well as momentary
identification of aircraft position upon request. The IFF modes provided
are:

Mode 1 Mode 3 Mode C
Mode 2 Mode 4 A/B

Mode 4 is used for highest confidence identification (crypto), and Mode C
is used for altitude reporting.

Modes 1, 2, 3 and C are selected/deselected from the UFC. Mode 1 and
Mode 8 codes can be input from the UFC; Mode 2 codes are set from the
IFF transponder control box located in the aircraft nose (door 3R) and
cannot be altered in flight. Mode 4 is keyed by maintenance personnel.
Mode 4 controls are located on the RICP (FCP, left console) and the ICSCP
(RCP, left console).

which are selected from Menu 1. The IFF submenus are used to select
IFF modes and codes and to program IFF phasing (automatic timing).

Menu 1 provides initial IFF status and access to the IFF submenu. Modes
are displayed next to IFF anytime a mode is selected (activated) and
indicates that the IFF is being powered (Figure D-38). If Modes 1 through
3 and C are not activated (via the UFC), the Mode 4 selector switch is in

Activation or deactivation of modes (1, 2, 3, C) can be accomplished
through UFC Menu 1. Type the mode you wish to turn on/off in the
scratchpad and push PB #8. “3C” entry activates both Mode 3 and Mode
C. Ifthe mode was not displayed (off) prior to pushing PB #8, the mode is
activated (to the previously set code) and appears next to IFF along with
the other active modes. If the mode was displayed at PB #3 (on), the mode
is deactivated and the corresponding number/letter disappears. Mode 4
can only be activated/deactivated through the FCP RICP Mode 4 selector
switch.

The codes for Modes 1 and 3 may be changed (and the system turned on, if
off) directly from Menu 1 by typing in the mode, dash and code on the
keyboard (e.g., to change Mode 3 to 43821, press 3, SHF, -, 4, 3, 2, 1; verify
scratchpad entry; and press the IFF button). The entered mode and code
are displayed next to the IFF button for five seconds. The legend then
reverts to displaying the activated modes. The Mode 2 IFF code cannot be
changed from the cockpit. The Mode 4 codes (A or B) can only be selected
with the Mode 4 selector switch in the front cockpit. Mode 1 code entries
are limited to 0-7 for the first digit and 0-3 for the second digit; so the
lowest code is 00 and the highest is 73. Mode 3 code entries are limited to
0-7 for all digits; so the lowest valid code is 0000 and the highest is 7777.

The IFF submenu is selected by pressing the IFF button with a clear
scratchpad. The submenu allows access to the various functions (modes,
codes and programming) of IFF Modes 1, 2, 3 and C (Figure D-39). Mode
4 information is never displayed on the IFF submenu. Mode 4 control can

To change the code from the IFF submenu (in this case Mode 1, code 01),
type the new code (0, 1) on the scratchpad and press the MODE button
(Figure D-41). Remember, when changing codes from Menu 1 enter both
the mode and code (e.g., 3 - 4821 or 1-01). The Mode 2 code is not
displayed and it cannot be changed from the cockpit. Mode 2 can only be
activated or deactivated from the cockpit.

Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_Part1_page_64.jpeg:
The IFF program submenu is used to program specific IFF modes and
codes to change as a function of time, which is referred to as “phasing”
(PH). Up to 18 different phases can be programmed. Only Modes 1, 2, 3
and C can be phased. Mode 4 must be changed manually on the FCP
RICP. Once activated, phasing is based on the CC/GPS clock time. As the
time passes the phase start time, the programmed modes and codes are
activated or deactivated automatically. Phasing is normally programmed
by the data transfer module (DTM); however, it can be manually
programmed or changed in the aircraft.

To enter the IFF phase programming submenu, press the PROGRAM
button. The asterisk adjacent to PROGRAM indicates that you are in the
IFF phase programming submenu. If IFF phases have been entered
either manually or by the DTM, a phase number appears next to PH at
PB #1. The selected modes, codes and time programmed for phase
number 1 are shown in Figure D-42, right.

To review information such as modes/codes selected and time for
activation, enter the appropriate phase number in the scratchpad and
press PB #1 or cycle PB #1 through the phases (previously programmed
phases only) in numerical order. If no phases are in the system, PB #1
will read “PH-0” and the legend will not cycle. If phases have been
entered, PB #1 will cycle through the existing phases. To program a
phase:

e Select the phase number. (Scratchpad entry only for initial
programming; scratchpad or cycling PB #1 for reprogramming a
phase already in CC memory).

e Ifyou wish a mode to be activated/deactivated for the phase, press
the desired MODE button, as required.

e Select a code for a mode by typing it on the scratchpad and pressing
the desired mode button. Note: even if a mode is not chosen for
activation, its code will change to whatever is shown on the
programming submenu (as a function of the phase time).

e To enter a phasing time, type the activation time on the keyboard
and press PB #10.

e To remove the indicated phase from the phases program, type zero
(0) in the scratchpad and press PB #1 on the IFF programming
submenu. This clears Modes 1, 2, 3, C and the time from the
selected phase number (Figure D-43).

e When programming is complete, deselecting the programming
submenu by pressing PROGRAM (PB #8) returns you to the IFF
submenu. Or you can return to Menu 1 or Data 1 using the MENU
or DATA key.

e To activate the phasing function, press PH (PB #1) on the IFF
submenu (not the IFF programming submenu). The current phase
number and the start time for that phase appear at PB #1/PB #10,
respectively. The phase which appears is the one whose start time
correlates with the current time of day (CC/GPS clock time).

When EMIS LMT is selected, the IFF is placed in a standby status (if it
was previously operating). When EMIS LMT is deselected, the IFF
returns to its previous modes and codes, or if phasing is activated, to the
appropriate phase.

Once the phasing is activated, the modes can be turned off/on and the
Mode 1/Mode 3 codes can be changed. The system will immediately
respond to the new selections. However, when the next phase time is
reached the settings change to those assigned to the new phase.

AAI

The aircraft’s Air-to-Air Interrogator (AAI) set provides A/A target
identification capabilities to assist the aircrew in accomplishing a variety
of tasks. The following discussion addresses AAI and Enhanced
Identification (EID) in only a basic fashion. A detailed discussion will be
addressed in a follow-on lesson in the air-to-air radar block of instruction.
The capabilities can be used to assist in:

e finding aircraft on the air-to-air radar.

e determining on the radar, which friendly aircraft is which.

e determining on the radar if an aircraft is friendly or hostile [based
on predetermined Rules of Engagement (ROE)/Positive
Identification (PID) criteria].

The interrogator set transmits challenge signals and receives target IFF
replies through the L-band antennas mounted on the main radar antenna.
The system evaluates the replies and generates display symbols
(diamonds or circles) on the A/A radar display (or the A/G radar display)
at the correct target range and azimuth position.

The UFC, in conjunction with HOTAS activation, provides the
mechanisms for controlling/implementing the interrogation. The radar
(both A/A and A/G) provides us information concerning the progress and
results of our interrogation. AAI interrogation can be interfaced from
UFC Menu 1 or from the AAI or EID UFC submenus.

The aircrew can make UFC selections, which determine how the AAI
interrogation will be implemented. Any combinations of Modes 1, 2, 3 and
4 can be interrogated with a single HOTAS switch action. Modes 1
through 3 can be interrogated such that replies to the mode (regardless of
code) are displayed (normal mode) or such that the interrogated
transponder must reply with both the correct mode and the correct code
(correct code mode). Mode 4 AAI always functions in the correct code
mode, with the code being A, B or both A and B.

UPFRONT CONTROL COMPONENT DESCRIPTION AND
FUNCTION

The upfront control (UFC) is the primary interface between the aircrew
and numerous aircraft avionics. It is powered up on engine start when
the first main generator comes on-line and remains operating as long as
either a main generator or the emergency generator (in AUTO or
MANUAL) is on-line.

Use of the UFC is integral to the operation of the aircraft equipment and
allows crew members to control the following systems:

UHF radios—including automatic direction finding (ADF), HAVE
QUICK (anti-jam feature) and KY-58 (secure voice feature)
functions

Inertial navigation system (INS) (most functions, including
present position coordinate entry and navigation point
entry/selection)

TACAN

ILS (instrument landing system)

NAV FLIR (navigation forward looking infrared)

IFF/SIF (identification friend or foe/selective identification
feature)

AAI (air-to-air interrogator) and EID (enhanced identification)
A/P (autopilot)

LAWS (low altitude warning system)

GCWS (ground collision warning system)

The above list is not all-inclusive. Other capabilities controlled through
the UFC will be covered in subsequent academic lessons.

Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_Part1_page_8.jpeg:
The front cockpit UFC is located between the MPDs and above the MPCD,
so that it is easy to see and operate without looking down into the cockpit
(Figure D-1, left). The rear cockpit UFC is located on the right subpanel,
just to the right and forward of the right hand controller (Figure D-1,
right). Both UFCs are identical and all UFC functions are available to
either crew member.
