LAWS

The LAWS is designed to warn you of descent below a predetermined
altitude above ground level (AGL). It uses the radar altimeter for altitude
measurement.

Control and display for the LAWS is provided on the UFC, Menu 1, PB #1
(Figure D-53). The system is alternately enabled (to the last selected
value) and disenabled by pressing PB #1 with an empty scratchpad.
Enabled status is indicated by the selected altitude replacing OFF at PB
#1.

To change the altitude, type the new number into the scratchpad, and
then press PB #1. The new altitude replaces the old one and the
scratchpad blanks. If the LAWS is not enabled (“OFF”), entering the
scratchpad value enables the LAWS.

AVI-3 D-74


Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_Part2_page_14.jpeg:
Warning Indications

In flight, if the actual aircraft AGL altitude goes below the LAWS
altitude, the LOW ALT warning lights and voice warning are activated.
The LAWS warnings are independent of the TF system. If the LAWS is
enabled on the ground, the LAWS does not provide the visual or aural
warnings until the aircraft climbs above the LAWS value and then
descends back down through the LAWS altitude. The LAWS warnings
also activate if the LAWS is enabled and the radar altimeter fails or if it
breaks track with aircraft parameters below 5000 feet (AGL), <60° roll
and <60° pitch.

The LAWS warnings (lights and voice) terminate if:
e The aircraft climbs at least 20 feet above the LAWS altitude.
e The LAWS function is turned off via the UFC.

e The LAWS altitude is changed to a value below the present aircraft
AGL altitude.

Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_Part2_page_15.jpeg:
Ground Collision Warning System (GCWS)

The central computer (CC) utilizes aircraft inputs to provide visual and
aural warnings of a controlled flight into terrain (CFIT). It is a passive
system in that it provides no automatic recovery. Not all impending
CFITs produce a GCWS warning.

The CC uses inputs from the INS, ADC, FCC, ATUs, radar altimeter and
PACS to compute the altitude (AGL) to initiate the warnings. If OWOFF
or INVARM (stores identified on the PACS does not match aircraft-sensed
stores aboard) is displayed on the HUD, the GCWS is inoperative.

GCWS modes are aircrew selectable through UFC Menu 2 (Figure D-54).

not selected. In a high speed steep dive the
warnings may occur too late to prevent ground
impact or an aircraft over-G.

Warnings are disabled. An OFF advisory is
provided above baro altitude on the HUD between
400-5000 feet AGL, if not in INST master mode.

Warnings are disabled, but there is no HUD
advisory that the GCWS is off.

When an impending CFIT is detected, a “pull up” voice warning is
provided (a maximum of four times (“PULL UP, PULL UP, PULL UP,

HUD (Figure D-55). The arrow indicates the up direction for recovery.
The aircrew should roll toward the arrow and pull to the OWS tone for

Enter the time via the keyboard. For the time 0730, type 0, 7, 3, in the
scratchpad, and press PB #8. Colons and trailing zeros do not have to be
used; leading zeros are required.

The CC clock time is used for command speeds to achieve TOTs, IFF
phasing and ETAs. The CC battery keeps the time running with electrical
power removed from the aircraft. The CC time reads OFF at aircraft
start. Anytime power is interrupted to the CC, TIME OFF is displayed at
PB #8. Assuming a good CC battery, simply pressing PB #8 redisplays the
current time. Command speeds, IFF phasing and ETAs are only as
accurate as the CC clock time. Command speed, IFF phasing and ETA
computations will not be provided with CC clock time OFF.

Setting the Time of Day (after GPS)

With GPS, the aircrew can choose among totally GPS time, totally CC
clock time or a partial CC clock time that is completed by GPS. Total GPS
time is always ZULU; the aircrew can choose to use local hours with the
minutes/seconds filled in with GPS sourced time. With weight-on-wheels,
power up will initialize the clock to GPS time, if GPS time is valid. If GPS
time is invalid, the clock will initialize to CC clock time. If GPS time

becomes valid, after power up, with weight-on-wheels and the aircrew has
not made a time input, the time will reset to GPS time.

The aircrew can use PB #8 to make partial time entries that will be
completed with GPS time (if GPS time is valid). The aircrew can also use
a complete time entry (hours, minutes, seconds), so that GPS time is
totally excluded. Lastly, by pressing PB #8 with a blank scratchpad, the
aircrew can reselect total GPS time (if valid) over CC time. Table D-2

AAI Submenu

The AAI submenu is accessed from UFC Menu 1, PB #8 (Figure D-46,
left). On the AAI submenu (Figure D-46, right), Modes 1 through 3 can be
activated and their respective codes can be entered in exactly the same
manner as the IFF. As with the IFF submenu, the asterisks indicate
which modes are selected for interrogation. The “N” or “C” following each
mode identifies which master mode is selected for each mode. The “N” or
“C” can be changed from either Menu 1 or the AAI submenu utilizing the
scratchpad. The “N” or “C” can be entered separately (AAI submenu) or in
conjunction with a mode or mode/code change (from Menu 1), or in
conjunction with a code change from the AAI submenu. The “N” indicates
that correct mode replies will be shown on the radar. The “C” indicates
that only replies with the correct code will be shown on the radar for that
mode.

Additionally the legend will read AUTO ID-EID if
the AUTO feature is selected on the EID submenu.
STT, PDT, will be discussed again in later lessons.
For now, in simple terms, with AUTO ID, STT or
PDT selected, the system will automatically start
an AAT interrogation sequence cycling through all
modes selected on the AAI (or EID) submenu, when
the radar enters track on a target and that target
does not already have an AAI-ID associated with it
(from a previous interrogation). The sequence
commanded via the auto ID feature is the same as
would result from a manual interrogation (via

HOTAS).

HOTAS

Activate an AAI interrogation sequence (defined by the asterisked modes
on the UFC) with pilot coolie switch outboard for greater than 1 second or
RCP right hand control (RHC) AAI switch forward for greater than 1
second. The switch action locks in the sequence for the selected modes,
each for the selected number of bars. Either crew member can stop their
own initiated sequence with a second switch activation for greater than 1
second. The pilot cannot stop a RCP initiated sequence, or vice versa.

Interrogation

The legend in the lower left corner (Figure D-47) of the A/A radar cycles
through each selected mode/master mode (AAI 1N, AAT 2C, AAT 3N, etc.)
as each is interrogated. Diamonds (Modes 1, 2 and 3 reply or low
confidence Mode 4 reply) or circles (high confidence Mode 4 reply) are
displayed at the correct azimuth and range on the radar. At PB #8
(AAT/EID) on the UFC Menu 1, the modes, codes and master modes (C or
N) will cycle through as they are interrogated. Once the interrogation is
complete both the radar and UFC Menu 1 return to normal format.

changes to the EID selections cannot be implemented from UFC Menu 1.
The legends on UFC Menu 1 showing selected modes and showing the
progress of an interrogation, as well as the A/A radar cues showing the
progress/results of an interrogation are the same as for AAI, except
information is prefaced by “EID” vice “AAI.” The HOTAS switchology is
the same, except the FCP coolie is moved inboard (vice outboard for AAT)
and the RCP interrogate switch is moved aft (vice forward for AAI). The
significance of PB #8 (“MX 2”) will be addressed at a later time.

D - 67 AVI-3


Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_Part2_page_7.jpeg:
Obviously, the capability to program two separate interrogation sequences
on the AAI/EID submenus provides a great deal of flexibility. The
optimum way to use the capability is totally situation dependent. Another
lesson, in the A/A radar block of instruction, will further address AAI/EID.
For now, consider the following examples.

AVI-3

You are flying night trail formation beyond visual range of your
leader. You have programmed the AAI submenu to interrogate
your leader’s discrete Mode 1 code (M1-11C) and the EID submenu
to interrogate for VFR traffic (M3-1200C).

You are flying a combat mission escorting a strike package. You
have programmed the AAI submenu to interrogate the strike
package’s discrete mode (M2-7777C) and the EID submenu to fulfill
the ROE to discriminate enemy aircraft—absence of Mode 4A and
absence of Mode 1 (M4A and M1-11N).

You are flying a low level training mission, and for see-and-avoid
you want to interrogate for both VFR civilian traffic (M3-1200) and
VFR military special use airspace traffic (M3-4000). You program
M8-1200C on the AAI submenu and M38-4000C on the AAT
submenu. You use correct code because you do not want to see
replies from IFR traffic squawking Mode 3.
