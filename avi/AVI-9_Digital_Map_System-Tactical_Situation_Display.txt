Introduction to the Display

Figure D-2 shows a very small portion of preplanned route A, target 8.A
and offset point 8.01A. Annotated on the diagram are several of the
symbols that you may see while using the TSD. More symbols are shown
in other figures. The route is entered either manually through the UFC
point data submenu or via the DTM. The range markers, both along track
and cross track, simply provide the user with visual cues to judge the
distance relationship between map geographic points and the aircraft
present position.

The groundspeed (GS) and bank angle (BA) selections at PB #5 and PB
#4, respectively, allow computation and display of a route course line
adjusted for planned aircraft turn radius. GS selections are 0, 420, 450,
480, 510, 540, 570 and 600. If 0 is selected, turn radius is not displayed
(i.e., the route turn points are connected by straight lines). Any BA and
GS selection other than zero provides the appropriate turn radii and
magnetic ground track from point to point. The groundspeed and bank
angle options are only available when the route at PB #9 matches the
route at PB #10 on the UFC Menu 1 or Data 1 display (e.g. current
aircraft route). BA is selectable on all TSD scales and is used to make
calculations such as ETA/ETE. BA selections are 30°, 45° and 60°.

Display Controls

In order to use the TSD controls and HOTAS, you must be in command of
the display (Figure D-3). A “SYSTEM IN USE” cue is displayed if a crew
member attempts to take command while the other is slewing a sensor cue

or commanding a sensor to the cue position (all through HOTAS action).

PB #1 causes avoidance point rings to be displayed or removed from the
TSD. RING is boxed when selected and the rings are displayed. The

avoidance points are automatically displayed (regardless of whether RING
is boxed or unboxed) if loaded for the route. Button numbers 2-3 have no

control function on this display.

BOT/CTR: Pressing PB #6 changes the aircraft position on the TSD.
With CTR selected, the aircraft symbol is positioned in the
middle of the display. BOT displays 75% of the selected
range in front of the aircraft. The maximum range that can

be displayed in front of the aircraft is 60 nm, using an 80 nm
display with BOT selected. The maximum range that can be

displayed behind the aircraft is 40 nm, on an 80 nm display

with CTR selected.

PB #7 selects the sensor for cueing, either A/G radar or
targeting IR. When either one is selected, its
corresponding cue symbol is displayed at the end of the
range and bearing line. The range and bearing line is
controlled by the TDC. The sensor cue position
(azimuth and range) is displayed in the upper left
corner of the display.

The term FLIR (forward looking infrared) can be
confusing as it is occasionally used interchangeably
with the night visual system (NAV FLIR) and
targeting IR. FLIR on the TSD always refers to the
targeting IR. Sensor selection is “HOTASable” in the
rear cockpit with the castle switch; it is not
“HOTASable” in the front cockpit. HOTAS will be
described later in this workbook.

HRM patch maps are normally commanded from

the A/G radar display. However, they can be
commanded from the TSD. PB #8 selects and displays
the HRM patch map display window. Display window
(DW) size is “HOTASable” in both cockpits with the
auto acq switch. The sizes available are 1.3, 3.3, 4.7
and 10.0 nm. A 0.67 HRM DW can be selected on the
air-to-ground radar display, but not from the TSD.

The system does not allow an HRM patch map to be
made of the entire display, i.e., to get a map of 10.0 nm
square, at least 20 nm range must be displayed on the
TSD. The other limitation imposed is that a 1.3 map
can only be commanded from 3.4 to 39.33 nm from the
aircraft, a 3.3 map from 4.4 to 48.65 nm, and a 4.7 map
from 5.2 to 77.65 nm. Within 8° of the nose and
outside of 60° from the aircraft ground track, a patch
map cannot be made (exclusion zone). An “X” appears
in the display window if any of the above limitations
exist. HRM patch mapping will be covered in later
lessons.

PB #9 displays the route selection. This button can be
cycled through routes A, B and C. There is no
requirement to have the TSD route match the current
INS/MN route. This means the B route could be
displayed showing the outline of a MOA or restricted
area while the INS/MN is providing steering to a

(Figure D-4) used for symbology alignment over the displayed
map.

Figure D - 4. BIAS.

After selection, the TDC is used to center the “X” symbol within the test
frame video. The X symbol is stationary while the test frame grid + moves
by inputs from the TDC. The TSD BIAS should be checked on every flight
to ensure aircraft position, sensor cueing, steer point and course line
symbology is correctly overlaid on the map.

The code in the upper right quadrant, 111b in Figure D-4, indicates which
RMR filmstrip is loaded.

RECAL: Map video calibration can be accomplished by selecting
RECAL at PB #6. When boxed, a 60-second cycle
begins. TSD routes and overlays are displayed;
however, no map will be displayed. RECAL is not
normally selected since map calibration is automatic at
power up. If the map is not clear, select RECAL to
initiate another calibration.

This button permits expansion of the map by a factor
of 10/7, allowing for greater magnification (about
1-1/2> times) of details. The range tic marks at the left

PP:

The legend below PB #17 normally shows PP (present
position). The PP format always displays the aircraft symbol
in the BOT or CTR position and displays the selected route
steer points in sequence (provided the range displayed is
adequate). PB #17 is used to select any point for TSD
navigation route look ahead. The first depression, with a
blank scratchpad, will display the first point on the route.
Each subsequent depression displays the follow-on route
points in order. When look ahead is selected, all points are
presented in the center of a north-up display, and the selected
point number is displayed below PB #17. The range scale
may be changed and will remain at the last setting until
changed again. Also, the aircraft symbol is removed from the
display (Figure D-6). In the look ahead display, the sensor
cue range and bearing line will originate from the direction of
the aircraft (i.e., the tail points back to the A/C). The look
ahead function is “HOTASable” with the FCP coolie and the
RCP castle switches. Coolie “up” in FCP or castle switch
“down” in RCP selects the look ahead function starting at the
first route sequence point.

Any look ahead point on the selected route can also be selected directly by
typing the desired sequence point number in the scratchpad of the UFC
and then pressing PB #17 on the MPD/MPCD. Return to PP can only be
done with HOTAS by depressing the auto acq switch in the cockpit in
command of the TSD.

If for some reason an invalid sequence point (decimal point error or a point
not on the route) is selected with the UFC, “ERROR” appears under PB
#17 for 5 seconds (Figure D-7), then the display returns to its previous
identification.

HOTAS Controls

In addition to the controls around the MPD/MPCD, there are several
controls located on the FCP stick and throttles as well as the RCP hand
controllers.

FCP Stick

The auto acquisition switch (Figure D-12) is the only stick-mounted
HOTAS control for the TSD. It controls the HRM display window (radar
footprint) size. Moving the switch forward reduces the size and moving it
aft increases the size. The size of the footprint determines the size of the
HRM patch map when commanded.

Depressing the auto acq switch returns the TSD to a present position
format from a look ahead format.

The coolie switch is a four position switch located

on the inboard front corner of the right throttle. Only
one switch position is used for the TSD. Moving the
coolie switch up (quick step) steps to the first
sequence point (look ahead format).

Just outboard of the coolie switch is the TDC. It
slews the sensor cue at the end of a range and
bearing line. Pressure on the TDC moves the cue
left, right, out (up on the display), or in (down on the
display). When the TDC is pressed and released, it
commands the sensor (radar/TGT IR) to slew to the
point defined by the sensor cue (hand-off).

Switch:

AVI-9

This switch works like the FCP throttle TDC switch. It
slews the sensor cue; it does not, however, hand-off.

This switch works like the FCP throttle laser fire switch;
at the first detent, it commands TSD sensor cue point
tracking. It also works like the front TDC; at the second
detent, it commands hand-off of the sensor. Depending on
the sensor selection on the TSD, hand-off means the TGT
IR slaves to the cue position or the A/G radar starts patch
mapping at the cue position.

This three position switch works exactly like the
FCP auto acq switch for TSD. Forward commands a
smaller DW size. Aft commands a larger DW size.
Depress (down) commands return from a look ahead
display to a present position display.

Pushing down on the castle switch (quick step) selects
look ahead to the first sequence point, just as the coolie
switch on the FCP throttle does. Moving the castle switch
forward decreases the map range scale and moving it aft
increases the map range scale. Moving the castle switch
to the left toggles between the radar and the targeting IR
sensor cue. The front cockpit has no HOTAS control for
changing from one sensor to the other.

Remote Map Reader (RMR)
Location

The remote map reader is located in the rear cockpit, on the right console
(Figure D-15).

Type Film

The RMR generates a color moving map video signal from aeronautical
chart data reproduced on 35mm filmstrips. Currently, there is film for
virtually all continental U.S. locations. (The film cassette is loaded and
can be changed in flight). One cassette covers a geographic area large
enough for almost any mission (e.g., Seymour Johnson to the west coast
on a single cassette).

Text from AVI-9_Digital_Map_System-Tactical_Situation_Display_page_28.jpeg:
Scale

The scale of the map displayed on the TSD is dependent on the range
scale selected by the crew.

@ For 80 nm display, the RMR uses a JNC or, 1:2,000,000 scale.
@ For 40 nm display, the RMR uses a ONC or, 1:1,000,000 scale.
@ For 20 nm display, the RMR uses a TPC or, 1:500,000 scale.

@ For 10 nm display, the RMR uses a JOG or, 1:250,000 scale.
INTERFACES

Radar

High Resolution Map

In the discussion so far, all references to A/G radar hand-off have meant
the high resolution map (HRM) patch mapping mode. This very high
quality ground mapping operation can produce resolutions as fine as 8.5
feet on patch maps constructed from as far away as 39.33 nm.

The high resolution map can be interfaced through the TSD to make a
“patch map” of a specific area.

Real Beam Map

The RBM scan pattern is displayed on the TSD screen either as a wedge
or baseball home plate shape originating from the aircraft present
position.

If less than a full sweep is selected at PB #9 (on the A/G radar display),
the scan pattern will appear on the TSD as a “V” centered on the A/G
radar cursor.

When RBM is deselected on the A/G radar display, the wedge, baseball

home plate or “V” shape will remain displayed on the TSD at the last
position displayed.

AVI-9 D - 22


Text from AVI-9_Digital_Map_System-Tactical_Situation_Display_page_29.jpeg:
Targeting IR

The targeting IR is a weapons delivery related system. This system can
be cued from the TSD to a line of sight for a specific geographic coordinate
location (viewed on the TSD map).

Upfront Control

The upfront control interacts with the TSD by enabling the crew members
to directly select look ahead points. By typing a point identification on the
scratchpad, and then pushing PB #17 on the TSD, that point will appear
centered on the TSD in a north-up format.

Inertial Navigation System (INS) / Embedded GPS/INS (EGI)

The INS or EGI provides aircraft attitude, heading, velocity and
acceleration information to (among other systems) the CC. With INS
selected as the present position source, the CC uses INS data to place the
aircraft symbol (INS present position) and sequence points on the TSD.
With EGI as the present position keeping source, the CC uses EGI data to
place the aircraft position and sequence points. The CC also uses
INS/EGI data to cue the A/G radar/targeting IR to the position selected on
the TSD (radar display window cue, targeting IR cue). Once the sensor is
cued, the sensor position is maintained by the CC using MN data, if INS is
the PPKS or EGI data if EGI is the PPKS.

Mission Navigator (MN)

The mission navigator is the central computer routine that maintains
aircraft present position independent of the INS or EGI. With MN
selected as the present position source, the CC uses MN data to place the
TSD symbology.

TSD Format With CC Failure

With CC failure the TSD/RMR format (Figure D-16) loses target and
cursor related functions. It continues to provide all primary status cues.
Two selectable parameters remain: map scale selection and INS position
update. With CC failure, the INS can be updated by first calling up the
UFC point data submenu and entering the new point and its lat/long.
Then overfly the point and press PB #16 (O/F UPDT) on the TSD display
to accomplish the update. This procedure updates the INS directly (no
Kalmann filtering), so exercise caution when using it.

COMPONENTS AND CONTROLS

The Tactical Situation Display (TSD) is a presentation of your aircraft
position in relation to a planned mission route, which has been
superimposed over a moving map format. Its primary function is to
display the planned navigation information. However, it also provides
sensor positioning/control information to the crew.

The TSD is composed of an MPD/MPCD display; hands on controls
(throttles/stick/controllers), commonly referred as HOTAS controls; and a
remote map reader (RMR) for the color moving map reproduced on 35mm
film strips. In the future, the RMR will be replaced by the digital map
system.

Multipurpose Display/Multipurpose Color Display (MPD/MPCD)

The TSD is selected by pressing PB #5 on the Menu 1 display (Figure D-1)
and is presented on either the MPD or the MPCD. Whether a color
display or monochromatic display is used is dependent on both the
situation and personal preference. At night the MPCD display can be too
bright, so some crew members put the TSD display on an MPD. Other
considerations for TSD placement include proximity to other displays such
as A/G radar or TF E-scope, type of mission and phase of flight. The
bottom line is that optimum TSD placement is dependent on a variety of
factors.

Symbology

There are several navigation symbols displayed on the TSD. Their
positions relative to the aircraft symbol and the moving map are INS or
MN determined depending on the present position keeping source. The
term “sequence points” is used in describing the F-15E navigation
symbols. This term is used to define a set of geographical points that can
be overflown or used for sensor cueing. The following is a discussion of
sequence points and symbology.

Steer points are defined geographical points that comprise the route to be flown.
They are labeled with whole numbers. Steer point circles are all the same size.
The circular symbol is also used to denote avoid or no-fly areas on the TSD. The
avoidance rings are variable in size according to radius data for each ring
loaded by DTM or at PB #9 on the point data submenu. Radii may be .9 to 99.9
nm. Avoidance rings will have the appropriate avoidance point number in the
center to show the center of the ring. Avoidance points are preceded by an “A”
prefix. Fifteen avoidance point rings may be loaded per route. Five avoidance
points/rings may be displayed at any one time on the TSD.

Aim points are associated with steer points. They are sensor significant points
used for off route sensor cueing and position updates. They are labeled with a
steer point number and one decimal place (e.g., 1.1). Each steer point can have
up to seven associated aim points.

Base steer point location.

The point prior to a target point is an initial point (IP). IPs follow the steer
point numbering system.

Aim points associated with IPs are shown as segmented squares. They follow
the same numbering system as aim points associated with steer points.

Target points are labeled by a whole number followed by a decimal point (e.g., 8.
also referred to as target syntax).

Target offset points are sensor significant points associated with target points.
They are labeled with a target point number and a decimal number in
hundredths (e.g., 8.01). Each target can be assigned up to seven different offset
points.

Bullseye (BE) points are used as reference points for bullseye bearing and
range. They may be route dependent or route independent. There is no number
next to the symbol to indicate which bullseye point is being used.

Aircraft present position with magnetic ground track readout. Current aircraft
position is the top intersection of lines (wingline).

Targeting IR cue (arrowhead) on the end of a range and bearing line from
the aircraft symbol to its selected position. The broken line indicates you
are not in command of the TSD.

Air-to-ground (A/G) radar high resolution map (HRM) patch map cue on
the end of a range and bearing line. The box appears square or
trapezoidal depending on display window (DW) size (1.3, 3.3, 4.7, or 10
nm) and range. The DW size corresponds to the size of the HRM patch
map that would result if commanded (e.g., 10 would represent a patch map
10 nm square). The broken line indicates not in command.

When the targeting IR cue or HRM radar cue has a dot attached to it, that
ground position is being point tracked and the cue is stabilized to that set
of coordinates. This function is available even when the aircraft is not
equipped with a targeting IR pod. When a hand-off is commanded (by
HOTAS action), the targeting IR will point at the area indicated by the
sensor cue symbol or the radar will make a patch map of the area enclosed
within the display window. Hand-off can be commanded with or without
point tracking.

The IR or HRM radar cue without the range and bearing line indicates the
targeting IR active LOS or the HRM radar active footprint (patch mapping
position). The active LOS of the sensors may or may not be the same as
that of the range and bearing line (RBL), depending on whether or not
they have been commanded (by switch action) to the RBL cue.

This symbol indicates the active RBM radar search pattern and A/G radar
cursor position. The symbol represents the A/G radar cursor. There is a
wide pattern for a full scan and a narrower pattern for a partial scan.

The HRM cue DW with an “X” in it indicates that the cue is outside the
range and/or azimuth capability of the radar for making patch maps, or
that a DW size/range incompatibility exists (the radar will not make a
patch map of the selected size because that geographical area is too close
or too far relative to aircraft present position). That area is within 8° of
the velocity vector, inside the minimum/outside the maximum range for
selected display window size, or outside the radar gimbal limits (60°).

This symbol indicates a mark point, identified with a whole number above
it. Mark points are loaded by either performing an overfly mark via the
UFC, a radar mark via the A/G radar display, a target IR mark, or an
automatic overfly mark when the weapon release button is depressed, for
an unplanned target. Up to 10 mark points may be displayed on the TSD.

An azimuth and range readout of the HRM radar cue or targeting IR cue is
displayed in the upper left corner. The active LOS of the HRM or the
targeting IR will correspond to the displayed AZ/Rng only if the sensor has
been commanded (through HOTAS action) to the corresponding cue.
