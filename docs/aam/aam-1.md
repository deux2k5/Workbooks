### Basic Aerodynamics

This section reviews basic aerodynamic forces and their control.

**Four Aerodynamic Forces (Figure D-1):**

* Lift
* Weight
* Thrust
* Drag

![Figure D-1. Aerodynamic Forces](AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_7.jpeg)

### Lift

Lift is perpendicular to the relative wind.

**Formula:**

```
Lift = 1/2 * air density * velocity^2 * coefficient of lift * wing surface area 
(L = 1/2 * ρ * V^2 * Cl * S)
```

**Pilot-Controllable Factors:**

* **Air Density (ρ):** Fly at lower altitudes for denser air.
* **True Airspeed (V):** Faster flight generates more lift.
* **Coefficient of Lift (Cl):**  Controlled by angle of attack (AoA).

**Wing Design Factors Affecting Lift:**

* **Camber:** Curvature of airfoil (flaps affect camber but are not typically used in maneuvering).
* **Planform:** Top/bottom view of wing/fuselage shape.

**Summary:**

Control lift by controlling:

* Air density (ρ) – via altitude
* Airspeed (V) – via throttles
* Coefficient of lift (Cl) – via stick (AoA)

**Figure D-2:**  Compares Cl curves for swept and straight wings.  Straight wings generate higher maximum Cl but stall abruptly. Swept wings have lower maximum Cl but can reach higher AoA without stalling. Maintain ≈30 units AoA for near-Clmax.

![Figure D-2. Cl Curve Comparison](AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_9.jpeg)


### Weight

Weight is the force of gravity acting towards Earth's center, regardless of aircraft attitude. It doesn't directly oppose any single aerodynamic force unless that force is aligned with Earth's center. Lift opposes weight in level flight. Thrust or drag oppose weight in vertical flight.

### Drag

Drag resists aircraft movement through air.  Three main sources (Figure D-3):

* Induced Drag
* Parasite Drag
* Wave Drag

#### Induced Drag

Drag resulting from lift generation.  High pressure air under the wing tries to flow to the low pressure area above, creating downwash behind the wing. Induced drag is the resistance to this downwash.  It increases at high AoA and low airspeeds.

#### Parasite Drag

Drag caused by disturbing the air mass with the aircraft's profile and attached components.

#### Wave Drag

Negligible at low speeds but significant at transonic speeds.  It arises from pressure disturbances that can't propagate forward at sonic velocities, creating compression and energy loss.

**Drag Divergence Mach:** The speed at which wave drag becomes significant.

**Figure D-4:** Shows drag divergence Mach for straight and swept wings. Swept wings delay drag divergence but reduce lift.  F-15E uses a 45° sweep as a compromise.

![Figure D-4. Drag Divergence Mach](AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_12.jpeg)

**Pilot-Controllable Factors Affecting Drag:**

* Air Density: Denser air increases drag.
* True Airspeed: Higher speed increases drag.
* Lift Coefficient: Higher lift (AoA) increases induced drag.
* Aircraft Configuration: More stores increase parasite drag.

#### Coefficient of Drag – Minimum Drag (Figure D-5)

Coefficient of drag (Cd) increases with AoA.

![Figure D-5. Cd Curve](AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_13.jpeg)

**Minimum Drag:** Achieved at 8-10 units AoA in the F-15E, providing best acceleration.  This corresponds to ≈¼ - ½ G at low speeds, ≈1 G at 400-500 KCAS, and 2-3 G above 500 KCAS.

#### Optimum Turn

Best trade-off between turn performance and airspeed control. Achieved at 16-22 units AoA in the F-15E.  Provides maximum turn rate at a given speed without energy depletion.

### Thrust

Thrust propels the aircraft forward, generated by engines. It depends on air mass and acceleration through the engine.

**Formula:**

```
T = M (V2 - V1)
```

Where:

* T = thrust
* M = air mass
* V2 = exit velocity
* V1 = intake velocity

**Pilot-Controllable Factors Affecting Thrust:**

* Air density: Fly at lower altitudes for denser air.
* True airspeed: Faster flight forces more air into the engine.
* Throttle setting: Higher engine RPM processes more air.


### Questions

![Figure D-6. Unlabeled Forces Diagram](AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_15.jpeg)

2. Air density (altitude), true airspeed, throttle setting.

3. Air density (altitude), true airspeed, lift coefficient (AoA), aircraft configuration.

4. Air density, true airspeed, lift coefficient (AoA).

5. a. True

6. b. False

### Stability

**Figure D-8:** Shows the three aircraft reference axes: longitudinal, lateral, and vertical.

![Figure D-8. Aircraft Reference Axes](AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_17.jpeg)

#### Longitudinal Stability

Longitudinal stability refers to pitch behavior.  Positive longitudinal stability means the aircraft tends to return to its trimmed AoA after a disturbance.

**Figure D-9:**  Shows the aerodynamic center (AC) and center of gravity (CG) along the fuselage reference line (FRL). The AC, where lift changes occur, is aft of the CG.

![Figure D-9. Force Axes](AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_18.jpeg)


**Figure D-10:** Shows stable and unstable CG/AC locations. For positive longitudinal stability, the CG must be forward of the AC. Further forward CG increases stability, while closer CG/AC increases pitch sensitivity (less stable, more maneuverable).

![Figure D-10. CG and AC Location](AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_19.jpeg)

**Figure D-11:** Shows the use of a horizontal stabilator to create a nose-up moment for longitudinal stability.

![Figure D-11. Longitudinal Stability](AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_20.jpeg)

**Figure D-12:**  Illustrates CG movement due to fuel burn and ordnance expenditure.

![Figure D-12. CG Movement](AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_21.jpeg)

In the F-15E, fuel burn has minimal CG impact. CFTs and aft-loaded stores have a greater destabilizing effect, especially at high AoA with centerline stores.  Aft CFT stores can move CG beyond the aft limit. CAS masks this, but with failed pitch CAS, wing store jettison may be necessary.

**Figure D-13:**  Shows the aft shift of the AC during supersonic flight.

![Figure D-13. AC Shift](AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_22.jpeg)

This shift makes the aircraft more stable, reducing stabilator authority. "Transonic dig in" (deceleration from supersonic) and "Mach tuck" (acceleration through Mach 1.0) are masked by the FCS, but can be significant with FCS failure.

#### Lateral Stability

Lateral stability refers to roll behavior. The F-15E has slightly positive lateral stability for rapid roll rates. CAS mitigates adverse effects. External stores generally increase lateral stability (except LANTIRN and centerline tank).

#### Directional Stability

Directional stability refers to yaw behavior. The F-15E has positive directional stability.  External stores, especially forward-mounted ones (e.g., LANTIRN), generally decrease directional stability.

**Stability Summary:**

F-15E has positive stability in all three axes, allowing both stability and rapid maneuverability.

2. Longitudinal stability depends on the relationship between:
    a. wing chord and lift vector

    d. pilot and WSO

### Answers

1. b. stabilize/destabilize

2. c. aerodynamic center and center of gravity

## Turn Performance

### Definitions

* **Instantaneous Corner Velocity:** Minimum speed for maximum G.
* **Sustained Corner Velocity:** Speed for maximum sustained turn rate at a given power setting.
* **Sustained Turn:**  Turn with constant speed and altitude.
* **Structural Limits:**  Maximum airspeed/G for structural integrity. Max G and Max Q define the flight envelope boundaries.

### Limits to Turn Performance

* **Amount of Lift Obtainable:** Higher lift generally improves turn performance. Controlled by altitude, airspeed, and AoA (Cl).

**Figure D-14:** Shows Clmax curve versus airspeed and G. Flight above/left of the curve is impossible due to stall. Chart is valid for a specific altitude.

![Figure D-14. Clmax versus Airspeed/G](AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_27.jpeg)

* **Amount of G Permissible:** Limited by aircraft design and/or operational restrictions.

**Figure D-15:** Shows G limit superimposed on Clmax curve. Max G decreases at higher airspeeds due to increased structural loads.

![Figure D-15. G Limit](AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_28.jpeg)

* **Amount of Thrust Available:** Determines sustainable G and maximum speed.

**Figure D-16:** Shows thrust limit superimposed on G limit and Clmax curve.

![Figure D-16. Thrust Limit](AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_29.jpeg)

**Figure D-17:** Shows all three limits combined, creating the aircraft's performance envelope for a given altitude, weight, and configuration.

![Figure D-17. Performance Envelope](AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_30.jpeg)

### Turn Performance Measurements

* **Turn Rate:** Degrees per second. Higher is better.
* **Turn Radius:** Feet. Smaller is better.

#### Turn Rate

**Formula:**

```
Turn Rate = (Radial G * g * K) / Velocity 
```

Where:

* g = gravity constant (32.2 ft/sec^2)
* K = conversion constant (57.3 deg/rad)

**Simplified:** Turn rate depends solely on true airspeed and radial G.

#### Turn Radius

**Formula:**

```
Turn Radius = Velocity^2 / (g * Radial G)
```

**Simplified:**  Turn radius depends on true airspeed and radial G.

**Key Concept:**  Any two aircraft with the same airspeed and radial G have the same turn rate and radius.  Difference in performance arises from G available at a given airspeed.

#### Radial G and the "Egg"

Radial acceleration (radial G) is the acceleration towards the center of rotation in a turn.

**Figure D-18:** Shows how lift vector components change with bank angle.

![Figure D-18. Radial G](AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_33.jpeg)

**Figure D-19:** Shows the relationship between total G (Gt), radial G (Gr), and weight (W).

![Figure D-19. Radial G](AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_34.jpeg)

**Key Concepts:**

* Lift vector above horizon: Gravity reduces radial G/turning performance.
* Lift vector below horizon: Gravity increases radial G/turning performance.

**Figure D-20:** Shows the "tactical egg" resulting from radial G effects during a constant airspeed loop.

![Figure D-20. Effects of Radial G on Constant Airspeed](AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_35.jpeg)

Understanding radial G is essential for successful air combat.

    c. thrust available and altitude
    d. gross weight and true airspeed

2. c. decreases

3. Thrust limit, G limit, lift limit.

4. a. True

6. b. true airspeed and radial G

7. a. increases

8. True airspeed, radial G

9. a. equal

### Performance Management

**Figure D-23:** Shows turn rate and radius plotted against Mach number.

![Figure D-23. Turn Measurements](AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_39.jpeg)

**Figure D-24:**  Superimposes the flight envelope on the turn measurements graph, creating a performance management chart.  This chart is specific to a given altitude, weight, and configuration.

![Figure D-24. Performance Management Chart](AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_40.jpeg)

#### Corner Velocity (Figure D-25)

The airspeed providing the highest turn rate and smallest turn radius.  It's the point where maximum G is achievable with the least airspeed. Exceeding corner velocity requires increasing G for the same turn performance, which is impossible beyond the G limit. Decreasing below corner velocity reduces available G, degrading turn performance. This plot assumes full afterburner and a horizontal turn.

![Figure D-25. Corner Velocity](AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_41.jpeg)

**Key Concept:**  Corner velocity turns are instantaneous, as airspeed will likely decrease, leading to degraded turn performance.

#### Sustained Corner Velocity (Figure D-26)

The lowest speed at which maximum sustainable G is achievable without exceeding the G limit.  It provides the best sustainable turn rate and radius for a given altitude and configuration.

![Figure D-26. Sustained Corner Velocity](AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_42.jpeg)

#### Maneuvering in the Tactical Egg (Figure D-27)

Optimizing radial G involves aligning lift and weight vectors.  The tightest turn at a given altitude and configuration is achieved while purely inverted at corner velocity.  The worst corner velocity turn is a vertical pull at the bottom of the egg.  A diagonal slice through the egg (oblique loop) offers a compromise between corner velocity and sustained turns.

![Figure D-27. Maneuvering in the Tactical Egg](AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_43.jpeg)

#### Maneuvering Strategies

* **Above Corner Velocity:**  Start turn at max G, slow down to corner velocity using idle thrust and speedbrake (up to ≈500 KCAS).  Retract speedbrake and select full afterburner just before reaching corner velocity.  At higher speeds, use AoA/G and power modulation for speed control (avoid excessive speedbrake use).
* **Below Corner Velocity:** Select full afterburner and turn at Clmax (≈30 units AoA).  Once able, unload to minimum drag AoA (8-10 units) with full afterburner.  For non-critical turns, use the optimum turn (16-22 units AoA).

**Figure D-28:**  Illustrates minimum drag and optimum turn AoA.

![Figure D-28. Min Drag/Optimum Turn AoA](AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_45.jpeg)

## Energy Maneuverability

### Introduction

Energy management is crucial for winning dogfights. Traditionally, this involved entering combat with more altitude and airspeed. Early energy studies focused on maximum speed, stall speed, ceiling, wing loading, and thrust-to-weight ratio.

#### Wing Loading

* Formula: Aircraft weight / wing surface area
* Provides a limited snapshot of lift generation for turning.

#### Thrust-to-Weight Ratio

* Formula: Maximum thrust / gross weight
* Provides a snapshot of thrust for acceleration or climb.

Both wing loading and thrust-to-weight ratio are inadequate for comprehensive performance comparison.

### Specific Power (Ps)

Ps measures an aircraft's ability to change its energy state relative to another aircraft in the same conditions.

**Formula:**

```
Ps = (V / g) * (dV / dt) + (dH / dt)
```

Where:

* V = true airspeed (ft/sec)
* g = gravity constant (32 ft/sec^2)
* dV/dt = acceleration (ft/sec^2)
* dH/dt = rate of climb/descent (ft/sec)

**Ps Interpretation:**

* Positive: Can climb, accelerate, increase G, or any combination without sacrificing other parameters.
* Negative: Must descend, decelerate, reduce G, increase thrust, or a combination.
* Zero: Flight parameters are balanced.  Changing one requires sacrificing another.

### Energy Maneuverability (EM) Diagram

**Figure D-29:** Shows an EM diagram with constant Ps contours and load factor lines. It represents an aircraft's performance capabilities at a specific altitude, weight, configuration, and power setting.

![Figure D-29. Energy Maneuverability Diagram](AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_51.jpeg)


#### EM Diagram Key Points

* **A:** Corner velocity (peak of performance envelope).
* **B:** Sustained corner velocity (intersection of Ps = 0 contour and max G line).
* **C:** Best energy rate at max G (tangent point of Ps contour and max G line).

#### Comparing Ps

EM diagrams offer a useful but imperfect method of aircraft comparison, limited to specific conditions and horizontal turns.  However, comparing diagrams for similar configurations provides valuable insight.
