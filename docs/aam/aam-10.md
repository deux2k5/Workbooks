### Post-Merge Maneuvering (Continued)

##### High Aspect, Offset, Turn Into, Switch (Continued)

* **Options (Continued):**
    * **Two-Circle:**  (Continued) ... Poor BFM by either fighter often allows the bandit to freely switch targets within the formation.

    * **One-Circle:**  (Continued) ...  The disadvantage here is that one of the fighters must “get in the phone booth” with the bandit while the other fighter works for the entry, sorts out who is who in the single-circle fight and waits for shot deconfliction to happen.

There are many permutations possible in a high aspect ACM engagement. The bandit may enjoy some initial freedom to switch, but should become defensive quickly if the element is working together and fulfilling their roles. No matter which scenario, the basic tenets remain the same—fly your best BFM, maintain flight path deconfliction and maneuver to kill the bandit.

#### Engaging Other Threats

* **Support Fighter's Job:** Protect the Engaged Fighter, which includes neutralizing any additional bandit threats.
* **Common Scenario:** Support Fighter spots another bandit attempting to engage the Engaged Fighter.
* **Immediate Engagement:** The Support Fighter must engage and kill the new threat before it becomes a problem for the Engaged Fighter.
* **Radar Contact Assessment:** Analyze range and aspect relative to the fight to determine the threat level.
* **Split Criteria:** Pre-briefed guidelines aid the Support Fighter in deciding whether to engage the new threat or monitor/drop it (see AFTTP 3-1, Volume 17 for more on split criteria).

#### Separation/Bugout

* **Post-Engagement:** Regardless of outcome (kill or survival), the element should separate from the bandit or bug out from the fireball.
* **Decision to Re-Engage:** The flight lead or defensive BFM requirements dictate whether to re-engage a surviving bandit.
* **Bugout Priorities:** Escape the fireball area (which attracts attention), regain mutual support, and reform as quickly as possible.

### Defensive ACM

#### Principles

* **Continuous Threat Detection:** Paramount for countering short-range attacks.
* **Methods:** Visual scanning, radar, RWR, and GCI/AWACS calls.
* **Early Visual Acquisition:** Crucial for successful defensive maneuvering.

#### Responding to Threats

1. **Threat Assessment:** Determine range and closure rate.
2. **Extension:**  Employ against out-of-range bandits with insufficient closure.
3. **Immediate Action:** Required when bandits are at or near weapons employment range.

**Defensive ACM Steps:**

1. Detect the threat.
2. Execute an initial defensive maneuver.
3. Defeat the attack using BFM and AAMD.
4. Maintain mutual support within the element.
5. Gain the offensive or disengage/separate.

#### Two-Ship Defensive Initial Moves

* **Well-Planned and Practiced:** Crucial for effectively negating the initial attack. 
* **Move Characteristics:** 
    * Aggressive
    * Rotate the aircraft's vulnerable aspect away from the threat. 
    * Simple and easy to remember.
    * Instinctive (achievable through practice).

#### Bandit at Six O'Clock (Approaching Weapons Range)

* **Avoid:** Positioning both aircraft in the same area simultaneously.
* **Recommended Formation:**  Laterally and vertically separated (good tactical formation).
* **Fighter with Tally:**
    * Execute a hard/break turn into the bandit.
    * Communicate the maneuver to the wingman.
    * Dispense chaff/flares as needed.

* **Fighter without Tally:**
    * Turn as directed by the wingman.
    * Dispense chaff/flares preemptively.
    * Pull maximum Gs.
    * Attempt to acquire the bandit visually.

#### Hard Turn vs. Break Turn

* **Hard Turn:**
    * Maximum afterburner for maximum energy.
    * Employed when the bandit is maneuvering for a shot but not yet within weapons parameters.
    * Use caution to avoid entering a WEZ in full AB.

* **Break Turn:**
    * Military power or less, chaff/flares dispensed.
    * Employed when the bandit is in a position to shoot or has already launched a missile.
    * Transition to afterburner once the bandit's threat is neutralized or they are outside weapons parameters.

* **Stores Jettison:**  Consider if separation is not possible, the bandit persists, and the aircraft is configured for it.

#### Separation Impossibility

* **Goals:**
    * Defeat any launched ordnance.
    * "Sandwich" the bandit and achieve a kill or force separation.
* **Determining the Engaged Fighter:** Dictated by the bandit's actions.
* **Support Fighter:** 
    * Maneuvers to employ weapons against the bandit.
    * Communicates clearly to establish roles and deconfliction responsibility.

### Visual Lookout Responsibilities and Range Estimation

#### Primary Visual Scan Areas

[Figure D-14: Primary Areas of Visual Search]

* **Pilots:** Primarily responsible for the area forward of their aircraft's 3/9 line.
* **WSOs:** Primarily responsible for the area aft of their aircraft's 3/9 line.

**Crew Coordination:** Coordinate visual scan areas to avoid redundancy. Use clear and concise communication (e.g., "I'm looking outside and to the right").

#### Formation Spread

Tailor formation spread based on the anticipated threat type and size. Greater separation reduces visibility across the formation, potentially allowing a bandit to get within weapons range before being detected.

#### Visual Range Estimation

[Figure D-15: Visual Lookout Bandit Range Estimation]

Use aircraft references to estimate the bandit's range:

* **30° Aft:** Positioned just off the leader's inlet ramp.
* **60° Aft:** Positioned just off the leader's wingtip trailing edge.
* **45° Aft (Down the Wing Line):** Bandit's range behind the wingman is equal to the element's line abreast separation distance.

**Key Takeaway:** Determining whether the bandit is within a WEZ is crucial for selecting the appropriate defensive response.

### Bandit Attack Options

* **No Switch:**  The bandit engages one aircraft and does not switch targets.
* **Early Switch:** The bandit initiates a target switch before losing the 3/9 line advantage on the initial target.
* **Late Switch:**  The bandit switches targets after crossing the new target's 3/9 line.
* **Uncommitted Bandit:** The bandit's position does not clearly indicate which aircraft is being targeted. 

#### Response to Bandit Attack Options

##### No Switch

* **Response:** Both Eagles execute a break turn into the bandit (see Figure D-16).
* **Engaged Fighter:** Flies their best defensive BFM.
* **Support Fighter:**
    * Flies offensive BFM to employ ordnance.
    * Exercise extreme caution to avoid fratricide, especially during the first 90-120° of the turn when shot opportunities are likely to present themselves.

* **Separation:** Generally difficult unless the bandit attempts a high-angle snapshot. The Support Fighter must be ready to continue BFM if a quick kill is not possible.

##### Early Switch

* **Definition:** The bandit initiates a target change before losing the 3/9 line advantage on the initial target (see Figure D-17). **Do not confuse bandit BFM with an early switch.**
* **Response:**
    * The fighter initially targeted calls "BANDIT SWITCHED."
    * The fighter who was switched to continues turning until they have visual contact with the bandit, then extends to gain energy/turning room, gets out of plane, and sets up for a re-entry.

* **Separation:**  Usually not possible.

##### Late Switch

* **Definition:**  The bandit switches targets after crossing the new target's 3/9 line (see Figure D-18).
* **Response:**
    * The initially targeted fighter executes a break turn as directed and attempts to acquire the bandit visually.
    * The fighter who was switched to breaks into the bandit, calls "BANDIT SWITCHED," and attempts to merge 180° out with the bandit to achieve separation.

* **Separation:**
    * Often possible if the newly engaged fighter flies good BFM.
    * Usually occurs in a 1-3 nm echelon/trail formation.
    * The newly engaged fighter must maintain tally on the bandit during the separation to decide whether to continue separating or defend against a renewed attack.

* **Element Objective:** Either separate and disengage or establish sufficient separation to re-engage the bandit from a high-aspect position. 

##### Uncommitted Bandit

* **Assessment:**  Rapidly evaluate the threat level based on the bandit's range and nose position.
* **Out-of-Parameters Bandit:**  Extend and monitor.
* **Threatening Bandit:** Execute an immediate defensive response.

##### Initial Move Objectives (Uncommitted Bandit)

A successful initial move should:

1. Deny the bandit a shot opportunity.
2. Force the bandit to solve a complex BFM problem.
3. Compel the bandit to commit to one target.
4. Maximize the element's offensive potential after the maneuver.
5. Clearly establish the Engaged (defensive) and Support Fighter roles.

##### Same Direction Break vs. Cross-Turn

###### Same Direction Break

* **Advantages:**
    * The fighter on the outside of the turn can maintain a visual on the bandit throughout the maneuver.
    * The bandit must commit to one of the fighters immediately.
    * The bandit's offensive potential is no longer equal against both fighters.
    * The element can readily establish Engaged/Support roles based on the bandit's actions.
    * Simplifies flight path deconfliction.
    * Isolates the threat to one side of each aircraft.

###### Cross-Turn Break

* **Disadvantages:**
    * Puts both fighters in the same airspace, allowing the bandit to delay target selection.
    * Increases the difficulty of element deconfliction, especially during the initial phase when focus should be on the bandit.  A good wingman stack can mitigate this.
    * Can happen unintentionally due to simultaneous break calls or confusion under pressure.

**If a cross-turn occurs:**  Continue the turn and prioritize flight path deconfliction.

#### Bandit at Mutual Six:  Response Considerations

* **Bandit Range**
* **Threat Axis:** Which fighter is the bandit most likely to target?

**General Guidance:**

* Both fighters should turn towards the bandit.
* The fighter who sees the bandit first should initiate the break call (e.g., "EAGLE, BREAK RIGHT").
* If a fighter determines the bandit is more likely to target their wingman, they can call for a break in the opposite direction (e.g., "EAGLE X, BREAK RIGHT").
* Initiate movement and communicate as soon as the bandit is detected. 

## Low Altitude Air-to-Air Employment

### Introduction

This text focuses on air-to-air employment considerations at low altitudes. While acknowledging the validity of medium/high altitude ingress options and mixed force packages, this discussion concentrates on autonomous low-level operations with F-15-only formations.

### Formation Considerations

#### Line Abreast

* **Similar to Medium Altitude:**  (See Figure D-1)
* **Considerations:**
    * Difficult maneuvering due to terrain.
    * Reduced visual contact in rough terrain.
    * Proximity of surface-to-air threats.

[Figure D-1: Line Abreast Formation]

#### Wingman Considerations

* **Increased Task Loading:** Formation flying demands more attention at low altitude.
* **Flexible Lateral Spacing (4,000 - 12,000 feet):**
    * **Closer (4,000 feet):** Easier visual contact when maneuvering, terrain, environment, and avionics workload are high.
    * **Wider (12,000 feet):** Reduces the chance of both aircraft being detected by a threat.
* **Spacing Limits:**
    * **> 12,000 feet:** Difficult to maintain visual contact and maneuver the flight effectively. Supporting the wingman after a 3/9 line swing becomes very challenging (especially with only AIM-9s available).
    * **< 4,000 feet:**  Guarantees the adversary will detect both aircraft. Increases flight path deconfliction challenges during turns and complicates visual arena defensive reactions (due to reduced reaction time, missile minimum ranges, and weapons deconfliction).

#### Trail or Wedge

* **Last Resort Formation:** Use only when necessary (e.g., extremely low altitude or very rough terrain).
* **Formation Parameters:** 
    * Fluid cone 30-70° aft of the leader.
    * Fluid range: 4,000-9,000 feet.

[Figure D-2: Trail/Wedge Formation]

#### Wedge Disadvantages

* **Loss of Visual Mutual Support:** Significantly increases risk to the trailing aircraft. 
* **Predictable Flight Path:**  Alerts ground threats after the lead passes, and allows airborne threats to attack the trailing aircraft without being seen by the lead.

#### Wedge Advantages

* **Flexibility and Maneuverability:**  Beneficial in low-threat environments.
* **Airspeed Considerations:** Adapt to terrain (450-500 KCAS may be too fast in mountainous areas; maintain at least 350 KCAS).
* **Airspeed Bleed-Off:**  Monitor closely during repeated maneuvering.

#### Airspeed

* **Throttle Response:** Quicker at low altitude.
* **Standard Tactical Formation:** 450-500 KCAS provides good offensive/defensive maneuvering potential.
* **Threat Avoidance:** Consider higher speeds (500-600 KCAS).
* **Deceleration:**
    * Poor above 500 KCAS.
    * Better between 500-450 KCAS.
    * Excellent below 450 KCAS.

* **High Airspeed (>500 KCAS):** Increased turn radius, limited speed brake effectiveness due to air loads.
* **Low Airspeed (<450 KCAS):** Full speed brake available.
* **SA-1:** External stores limitations (carriage, employment, and jettison) become a factor.
* **Key Takeaway:** Balance the "speed is life" principle with the need for maneuverability at low altitude.  Deceleration to an optimal maneuvering speed requires prompt response and careful monitoring.

#### Turns (Line Abreast)

##### Comm-Out Turns

* **Signaling:** Wing flash.
* **Execution:** Similar to medium/high altitude turns (without vertical maneuvering).
* **Challenge:** Wingman's attention is divided between ground clearance and formation, potentially causing them to miss wing flashes. Mitigate this with good crew coordination and lookout responsibilities.

##### Check Turn Method

* **No Wing Flash:** Uses check turns for turn initiation and control.
* **Turning Away from Wingman:**
    1. Leader abruptly turns 30° and rolls out.
    2. Wingman recognizes this as a turn command and initiates a 90° turn towards the leader.
    3. Leader completes the turn as the wingman passes through their 6 o'clock position.

[Figure D-3: Turn Away from the Wingman]

* **Turning Towards Wingman:**
    1. Leader rolls into and completes the turn in one maneuver.
    2. Wingman executes a 30° check turn away from the leader upon seeing them turn.
    3. Wingman completes the turn (using visual references) when the leader passes through their 6 o'clock position.

[Figure D-4: Turn into the Wingman]

##### Considerations

* **Quicker Turns:**  Aircraft response and energy sustainability are better at low altitude, allowing for tighter turns and reduced planform highlighting.
* **Timing:**  The second aircraft to turn must wait longer than at medium/high altitude before initiating their turn.
* **Jet Wash:**
    * Avoid flying through it when under high G-loads (risk of over-G or control issues).
    * If unavoidable, cross as close to perpendicular as possible with minimal aircraft loading to minimize effects.

* **Rough Terrain:**  Reduce lateral spacing to maintain visual contact.
* **Ground Proximity:** Remain aware of limited vertical maneuvering room below the aircraft.

#### Pilot's Primary Cross-Check 

* Terrain
* Formation position
* Altitude
* Flight path deconfliction (especially during turns)

**Timing of Turn Initiation:** Can be a shared responsibility between the pilot and WSO using either the wing flash or 30° check turn method. Adapt the chosen procedure based on flight experience and tactical needs.

### Crew Coordination

#### Importance

Effective crew coordination is vital for mission success in the F-15E. 

* **Avoid:** Constant intercockpit communication (leads to communication saturation).
* **Importance:**  Shared understanding of mission priorities and task loading/management allows for better task sharing and overall workload reduction.
* **Tailor:** To the experience level of both crew members, the specific mission, flight positions, and individual skills.

#### Terrain Avoidance

* **Top Priority:** While operating at low altitude.
* **Pilot:** Primarily responsible for terrain clearance.
* **WSO:**  Provides situational awareness support by:
    * Calling out upcoming terrain features based on the E-scope or TSD.
* **HUD Velocity Vector:**  Cross-check every 3-5 seconds to ensure clearance, especially during turns.
* **AGD-1:** Consult for specific low-altitude parameters and maneuvering procedures.

#### Visual/Formation Position

* **Shared Responsibility:** Maintain visual contact and proper formation.
* **WSO:** Provides formation advisories and turn calls, understanding the pilot is primarily focused on terrain avoidance.
* **Pilot:**  Cross-check formation position frequently for timely reactions to checks, turns, and airspeed changes.

#### Communication Technique

* **"Heads Down/Up":**  Indicate whether looking inside or outside the cockpit.
* **"Outside/Inside":** Indicate which side of the formation you are focused on.
* **"By Exception":** Assume the other crew member is looking outside the aircraft unless specifically stated otherwise.

#### Turns

* **Pilot:**  May select AUTO GUNS towards the direction of the turn (beware of potential lead lock) and focus primarily on terrain avoidance.
* **WSO:** 
    * Checks the flight's old 6 o'clock position when turning first.
    * Checks the flight's new 6 o'clock position when turning second.
    * Advises the pilot on turn timing relative to the lead.

* **Roll Out:** Transition back to standard visual lookout procedures and WSO radar control.

#### Systems Operation

* **Pre-Flight Coordination:** Determine air-to-air radar control, hand-off procedures, and agree on techniques/procedures. Prioritize mission success over personal preferences.
* **System Hand-Off:**  If the WSO is more proficient with radar, they should control it. Have a plan to hand off systems to the WSO if the pilot's attention is demanded by formation or low-altitude flying.
* **Merge Basics:**
    * Optimize aircraft performance.
    * Maintain vigilant visual lookout. 
    * Utilize aircraft systems (e.g., ALE-45). 
    * Fly accurate BFM.

* **Non-Air-to-Air Configuration:**
    * Air-to-ground munitions limit maneuvering to 6.0-6.5 G symmetrical and 3.0-4.8 G asymmetrical.
    * Consider jettisoning stores if speed drops below 350-400 KCAS and you are defensive.

* **Offensive BFM:** WSO monitors the wingman, checks six, and scans for other bandits entering the fight.
* **Countermeasure Coordination:**  Coordinate chaff/flare deployment to avoid over- or under-dispensing.

**Key Takeaway:** Adhering to basic fight principles is even more critical at low altitude. Variations in aircraft performance and ground proximity demand a more conservative and controlled approach.

### Employment Considerations

#### Radar Set-Up

* **APG-70 at Low Altitude:** Special considerations apply.
* **DRSP Gain Reduction:** The 044 Digital Radar Signal Processor automatically adjusts sensitivity based on signal-to-noise ratio to filter out sidelobe feedback and background noise (increases target detection threshold).
* **HPRF:** Provides the strongest signal transmission for enhanced detection at low altitude (significantly more power than MPRF).

##### PRF Selection

* **HPRF Only:**  Detects only high-aspect targets, potentially missing bandits in the beam or tail aspect within 20 nm.
* **MPRF:** Detects low-aspect targets within 20 nm (sufficient signal-to-noise ratio).
* **Recommendation:** Use interleaved search at low altitude for both long-range (HPRF) and short-range (MPRF) target detection.

##### Additional Radar Setup Techniques

* **Frame Store (FS):**  Wingmen should consider FS2 to retain track files while managing other low-altitude tasks.
* **Range Scale:**  Use 40 or 80 nm scope to exploit the APG-70's long-range detection capability for early threat detection and decision-making.
* **Sweep Scan:**  Start with 120° for maximum detection, then narrow to 60° to aid sorting once groups are identified.

#### Radar Search Plan

##### Two-Ship Formations

* **Wingman:** Assign high search responsibility.
* **Rationale:**  Lead has more time/capability for the complex avionics work, while the wingman focuses on formation and other low-altitude priorities.
* **Overlap:**  Maintain at least 2,000 feet of search overlap at the briefed acquisition symbol range (typically 20 nm, but consider terrain features). 

##### Four-Ship Formations

* **Options:** 
    * Element leads split high/low search (1-low, 2-high, 3-high, 4-low).
    * Wingmen split high/low search (1-low, 2-high, 3-low, 4-high). 

* **Advantages of Lead Split:**
    * Better overall picture for air-to-air targeting through element communication. 
    * Each wingman can "see" the radar picture being discussed by the other element.

* **Disadvantage of Lead Split:** Places the more difficult low-altitude search task on one of the wingmen. 

**Choosing a Search Plan:** Consider:

* Wingman experience/ability.
* Expected adversary capabilities/weaponry.

**Examples:**

* Experienced wingmen can handle low-altitude search.
* If facing medium/high BVR threats, a lead with high search is advantageous. 
* If facing low-altitude IR missile threats, both leads should have low search responsibility. 

#### Visual Lookout

##### Importance

Clearing for air-to-air threats is a critical task at low altitude.

##### Principles

* **Disciplined Search Pattern:** Develop a logical and efficient scan that covers the entire field of view (FOV) with emphasis on briefed areas of responsibility.
* **Formation-Based Responsibilities:**  Refer to Figures D-5 and D-6 for search area assignments.

[Figures D-5 and D-6: Wedge and Line Abreast Visual Search Diagrams]

* **Vertical Scanning:** Don't limit your scan to the horizontal plane. Start at the horizon and scan vertically upwards.
* **Range Progression:** Scan from gun range (most immediate threat) outwards to missile range.
* **Movement Detection:**  Focus on a point on the horizon and look for any movement. 
* **Blind Spot Checks:** Use check turns to enhance 6 o'clock coverage, but be mindful of highlighting the aircraft's planform against the horizon. A 30° turn with 3-5 Gs allows for a six o'clock check with minimal course deviation. 

##### Search Area Prioritization

1.  Flight's 6 o'clock position.
2.  Through the wingman (as discussed above).
3.  Forward hemisphere (supplemented by radar). 

**Important:**  The wingman on the side of a potential threat is best positioned to detect it due to lateral separation and threat range.

#### HUD Use

* **Maintaining Situational Awareness:**  Provides valuable parameter information while allowing for "heads-out" flying, which is essential at low altitude. 
* **Cross-Check:** Always incorporate the HUD into your overall scan, with terrain as the primary focus. 
* **Velocity Vector:**  Use as a level flight reference during turns. 

### Low Altitude Intercepts

#### General Considerations

* **Terrain Awareness:**  Maintains highest priority. 
* **Turn Timing:** Smaller turn circles at low altitude require adjustments to intercept timing and pursuit curves:

| Original Pursuit Curve | Adjusted Pursuit Curve |
|---|---|
| 15 AA at 15 nm | 15 AA at 8 nm |
| 14 AA at 10 nm | 14 AA at 7 nm |
| 13 AA at 10 nm | 13 AA at 6 nm |

* **Hotter Intercepts:**  Possible at low altitude; adjust aspect angles and pursuit curves based on target speed.
* **Fuel Management:**  Afterburner use at low altitude rapidly depletes fuel; accelerate in AB and sustain speed with military power. 

#### Low-to-High Intercepts

* **Maneuvering Considerations:**  Evaluate both vertical and horizontal maneuvering room.
* **Optimum Maneuver:** Chandelle, utilizing both vertical and horizontal offset, to a low 6 o'clock position without leaving the bandit's blind spot.
* **Tally:** Generally easy to acquire unless there's a large altitude difference.
* **BFM:** Basic fighter maneuvering principles apply from tally to kill. 
* **Terrain Avoidance:**  Less critical due to nose-high entry, but be mindful of:
    * **Squaring the Corner:** Avoid slowing down too much at low altitude during the final turn. It's better to overshoot with energy.
    * **Altitude Illusion:** After prolonged low-altitude flight, 2,000 feet AGL can appear deceptively high. Avoid this potentially fatal misjudgment, especially during pop-up attacks or engagements with helicopters. 

#### High-to-Low Intercepts

* **Detection:** Utilize GCI, AWACS, and the APG-70 to detect low-altitude threats.
* **BVR Engagements:** Ideal, but some situations require a low-altitude conversion for weapons employment.
* **Challenges:** Gimbal limits, beam clutter, terrain masking, and target camouflage can complicate low-altitude kills.
* **Pre-Conversion:**  Clear the area around the target with both radar and visual scans to avoid being sandwiched.

##### Conversion Procedure

1. **Early Tally:**  Acquire at 8-10 nm using the TD box and/or canopy code information.
2. **Avoid Pure Pursuit:**  Sacrifices vertical turning room and forces a slow "square corner" maneuver. 
3. **Maintain Vertical Separation:** Keep several thousand feet above the target while maintaining proportional nose tracking to their LOS. 
4. **Initial Turn:**  Execute a hard turn above the target in a 2D POM (can be slightly descending to conserve energy) until behind their 3/9 line. 
5. **Final Stage:** Drop the nose, gain closure, and enter firing position while monitoring both the ground and the target.
6. **Airspeed Advantage:**  Achievable in a tail chase if vertical separation is maintained during the final portion.

#### Co-altitude Intercepts

* **Similar Challenges:** Terrain masking and target position estimation remain concerns.
* **TSD:**  Use to predict target position when visual contact is lost.
* **Radar:**  Generally effective over flat or gently rolling terrain.
* **Weapons Employment:** More challenging in a low-to-low profile.
* **Pursuit Curves:**  Remember the adjusted values for low altitude and adapt for target speed.

#### Common Low Altitude Intercept Errors

* Engaging a shadow instead of the target.
* Failing to acquire a visual before the radar loses lock.
* Carrying excessive airspeed, increasing turn radius, G-requirements, and deceleration difficulty.
* Starting the conversion too late and struggling to generate closing velocity.

#### Conversion Aborts

* **Avoid:** Split-S type maneuvers. 
* **Maximum Roll:** 135°.
* **Safe Altitude:** Aim for a slice to an altitude slightly higher than the target's. 
* **Dive Recovery:** If parameters are exceeded or the conversion becomes uncomfortable, immediately roll wings level and recover. Refer to the F-15E Dash 1 or AFTTP 3-3 for dive recovery procedures.

#### High/Low Speed Target Considerations

* **Faster Target:** Requires a colder pursuit curve with sufficient offset to maintain energy during the final turn. Monitor radar for closure and target speed (obtain from AWACS/GCI if necessary).
* **Slower Target:** Requires careful closure and aspect angle management to avoid overshooting.

### Weapons Selection

#### Low Altitude Considerations

* **Reduced Weapons Envelopes:** Increased air density impacts missile kinematics and seeker performance (high ground clutter). 
* **Missile-to-Ground Impact:**  A risk with all missile launches.
* **Pursuit Curves:**  Missiles fly a pursuit curve (usually lead) for a 0° LOS impact. 
* **Launch Attitude:**  Firing with a slightly nose-high attitude reduces ground impact risk.
* **Low Altitude Launch:** Seeking a look-up shot (blue sky) may improve acquisition but increases the risk of ground impact if the launch altitude is insufficient for the missile to gain flying speed.

#### AIM-120

* **First Shot Opportunity:** Typically due to its long-range capability.
* **Advantages:**
    * Off-boresight capability.
    * All-aspect, BVR performance. 
    * Active seeker (no continuous illumination required).

* **Post-Launch:**  The launch aircraft can maneuver to break LOS and utilize terrain for cover while the missile is active. 
* **Time-to-Active:** Relatively quick at low altitude (refer to AFTTP/AFTTP 3-1, Vol XVII). 

#### AIM-7

* **Launch Considerations:** 
    * Meet seeker head requirements. 
    * Ensure sufficient altitude to prevent ground impact during initial flight. 

* **Sustained LOS:** Both the F-15E radar and missile must maintain LOS with the target throughout its flight, unlike the AIM-120. 
* **Terrain Masking:** Can disrupt radar/missile LOS.
* **Maintaining LOS:** Similar maneuvers used for visual contact also help maintain radar LOS, but altitude may need to be higher than desired for adversary denial.
* **Shot/Kill Criteria:** Consult AFTTP 3-1.

#### AIM-9

* **All-Aspect Capability:**  Maintained at low altitude, but ranges are significantly reduced. 
* **Seeker Tracking:** Verify both visually and aurally, as adverse IR sources can pull the seeker off target.

#### Gun

* **Key Factors:** Range, lead, and plane of motion (POM). 
* **POM:** Even more crucial at low altitude due to the primarily 2D nature of the fight. Out-of-plane maneuvers by either aircraft can be catastrophic. 
* **Lead Pursuit:**  May put the attacker on a collision course with terrain.
* **Careful Control:** Manage G, closure, airspeed, and relative position for a good tracking solution.
* **Wake Turbulence:**  Can cause out-of-plane issues when crossing the bandit's 6 o'clock. 
* **Missile Threat:** Remain aware of the possibility of a missile launch.

### Contingencies

#### No Radar/Bad Systems

##### Essential Systems

* RADAR
* INS
* ICS/CMD
* RWR
* IFF/MODE IV
* Weapons Systems

##### System Failure

* **Go/No-Go:**  Determined by pre-flight briefing and mission stage at which the failure occurs.
* **Radar Loss:**
    * Failed radar aircraft becomes tactical wingman.
    * Aircraft with functioning radar assumes tactical lead. 
    * Radar-equipped aircraft assumes support fighter role and ensures visual contact with the tactical lead. 
    * Communicate tactical information to the aircraft with the failed radar (plan, tactics, tallies, etc.).
* **Avoidance:** Often the safest option unless mission dictates otherwise.

#### Group Targeting/Sorting

* **Similar Principles:** Maintain the same discipline used at medium/high altitudes.
* **Range Adjustments:**  Minimum ranges can typically be reduced due to smaller weapon envelopes at low altitude (see AFTTP 3-1 Vol XVII).
* **Recommended Ranges:**
    * Group targeting: Complete by 20-25 nm.
    * Element sort: Complete NLT 15 nm from merge.
* **Meld Range:**  Crucial to brief and adhere to, given the high radar LOS rates on short-range displays.

#### Short Range Radar Contact/Commit

* **Immediate Action:**  Required if a hostile contact is detected within 15 nm and converting towards the flight. 
* **Engaged Fighter Actions:**
    * Maneuver to engage and communicate "engaged" status.
    * Launch a missile if within parameters.
    * Acquire a visual tally using canopy code references and the HUD TD box.
    * Communicate target information to the flight.

* **Wingman:** 
    * Avoid maneuvering into the same plane of motion as the Engaged Fighter.
    * Stay low and establish a support position for a split-plane BFM entry at the merge.

* **Post-Merge:**  Element can either continue engaging or transition to a high-aspect separation.

#### Element Targeted/Threat Reactions

##### BVR Threat (Forward Quadrant)

* **No Radar Contact:** Maneuver the element to position the RWR spike on the beam. Search for visual contact or a launched missile. 
* **Active Engagement:** Exploit missile range, shot doctrine, and F-pole maneuvers.
* **Low Altitude Fox-1s/F-Poles:**  Avoid terrain masking that disrupts radar LOS. Simple avoidance maneuvers can also cause gimbal lock.
* **Wingman Awareness:**  The wingman on the outside of the formation (relative to the threat) will lose radar SA sooner than the lead.
* **Low Altitude AIM-120 Tactics:**  See AFTTP 3-1 Volume XVII.

##### Notching a Bandit

* **Initiation Range:** 12-10 nm (depending on the threat). Use radar and RWR information to determine the initial heading for a beam position. 
* **Beam Maneuver:**
    * **Method 1:** Check 10° back towards the bandit every 5 seconds. Execute an idle power break into the bandit (visually acquired) after 35-40 seconds (70-80° of total turn).
    * **Method 2:** Check 10° into the bandit after 10 seconds, then 9, then 8, and so on.  Execute the break when the interval reaches 5 seconds (70° of total turn). 

* **Break Range:** 2-4 nm from the bandit.
* **Post-Break:**  Should result in a high-aspect merge and a disengagement opportunity. 
* **IRMD:** Crucial to avoid a beam IR missile shot from the bandit. Acquire a visual early and employ effective IRMD.
* **All-Aspect/IR Missile Defense Tactics:**  Consult AFTTP 3-1 Volume XVII.

##### Stern Threat

* **Actions:**
    * Select afterburner and attempt to increase separation.
    * Execute a "float" maneuver (each aircraft executes a 20-30° check turn away from their wingman). 

* **Bandit's Decision:** The trailing bandit must decide which aircraft to pursue as the element's separation widens (2-3 nm). 

* **Wingman Entry:** If the bandit continues pursuing one of the element members, this creates a turning entry opportunity for the other fighter (see Figure D-7).

[Figure D-7: Stern Threat Contingency]

* **Mini-Pince:**  If the bandit remains between the element, they can execute a mini-pince when lateral separation reaches approximately 4 nm (see Figure D-8). Consult AFTTP 3-1 Volume XVII for more details.

#### Other Contingencies

Consider and brief these additional scenarios, which are often mission-dependent:

* Lost contacts
* Blind wingman
* Low fuel
* Battle damage/wounded aircraft
* F-15 losses
* Abort criteria
* Winchester missiles
* ALE-45 usage/programming
* Surface-to-air threat reactions
