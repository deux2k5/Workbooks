## Text

### Definitions/Terms

The radar provides a 2D representation of a 3D event.  MPD/MPCD air-to-air displays help visualize intercept geometry. This text focuses on interpreting information and employing the F-15E in intercepts.  Note: Peripheral pushbutton legends and some air-to-air display legends have been omitted for clarity.

**Intercept:**  A maneuver from beyond visual range to employ ordnance, visually identify the target, and/or enter visual combat. Intercepts can be flown using GCI/AWACS, onboard radar, or both.

### Heading Crossing Angle (HCA)

HCA is the angle between projected flight paths of the target and fighter (Figure D-1). Maximum HCA is 180° (head-on). HCA depends on both fighter and target headings and changes when either aircraft maneuvers.

![Figure D-1. Heading Crossing Angle](AAM-2_Intercepts_page_8.jpeg)

### Target Relative Heading Vector

In STT and TWS modes, a "stick" shows the target's heading relative to the fighter (Figure D-2). Use this as a general heading and maneuvering guide, not for magnetic heading or aspect angle.

![Figure D-2. Target Relative Heading Vector](AAM-2_Intercepts_page_9.jpeg)

### Aspect Angle (AA)

AA is the angle from the target's tail to the line of sight from target to fighter (Figure D-3). AA is independent of fighter heading but depends on target heading. Maximum AA is 180° (H for Head), minimum is 0° (T for Tail).  Radar displays show AA with L or R indicating the target side visible to the fighter. AA determines the intercept quadrant. AA and range are primary intercept geometry indicators.

![Figure D-3. Aspect Angle](AAM-2_Intercepts_page_10.jpeg)

### Antenna Train Angle (ATA)

ATA is the angle from the fighter's nose to the radar line of sight (Figure D-4). It's where your radar points. Due to limitations, ATA is limited to ±60° in search and ±73° in STT. ATA depends on fighter heading, not target heading.  Figure D-4 shows a 15° left ATA.

![Figure D-4. Antenna Train Angle](AAM-2_Intercepts_page_11.jpeg)

### Collision Antenna Train Angle (CATA)

CATA is the ATA for a collision course (Figure D-5). Maintaining CATA keeps a constant line of sight.  Changes in target heading/airspeed or fighter airspeed affect CATA. Fighter heading doesn't affect CATA, but depends on CATA for a collision course intercept. A target on CATA maintains constant azimuth and AA.  CATA provides quickest intercept and maximum overtake conservation. For co-speed targets, CATA = 180° - AA. Offset the target from radar center by CATA toward the side opposite the target's AA. Example: 15R AA implies 30° left CATA.

Outside 1.2 aero, center the MRM steering dot in the ASE circle to fly CATA. Inside 1.2 aero, this provides missile-to-target, not aircraft-to-target, collision steering.

![Figure D-5. Collision Antenna Train Angle](AAM-2_Intercepts_page_12.jpeg)


### HOT/COLD

HOT/COLD (Figure D-6) refers to areas on the radar display that increase (HOT) or decrease (COLD) AA. CATA separates HOT/COLD. Maintaining a target HOT decreases turning room and increases AA. Maintaining a target COLD increases turning room and decreases AA.  The HOT side is the side with the CATA. The COLD side is opposite, indicated by the AA letter (15L means left is COLD, 15R means right is COLD).

![Figure D-6. HOT and COLD](AAM-2_Intercepts_page_13.jpeg)

### Target Drift

Drift is the change in scope azimuth when a target isn't on CATA.  Interpreting target drift is crucial for intercept control and decision-making.

**Nonmaneuvering Target Drift Rules (Figure D-7):**

1. A target on CATA tracks straight down the radar display with constant AA (target B).
2. Targets not on CATA drift away from their CATA (targets A, C, D, E).
3. Drift is steepest (less drift) near the CATA (target A).
4. A target on the nose drifts cold (target D) (except H aspect, which is on the CATA).

![Figure D-7. Target Drift](AAM-2_Intercepts_page_14.jpeg)

The fighter will cross in front of target A (hot side), initially increasing AA. Target C drifts cold despite being initially left, with the fighter passing behind.


### Pursuit Types

Three pursuit types are used for stern conversion:

#### Pure Pursuit

Fighter's nose points at the target (Figure D-8). Radar shows the target at zero azimuth, SRM steering dot centered in ASE circle. HUD TD box is on the waterline.

![Figure D-8. Pure Pursuit](AAM-2_Intercepts_page_16.jpeg)


#### Lead Pursuit

Fighter aims ahead of the target to gain closure or increase AA (Figure D-9). Radar shows target on the hot side. HUD TD box is below the waterline.  In lead pursuit, continuously adjust heading toward the target's heading to keep the target hot. Turning rejoins use lead pursuit.


![Figure D-9. Lead Pursuit](AAM-2_Intercepts_page_17.jpeg)

#### Lag Pursuit

Fighter aims behind the target to reduce closure or decrease AA (Figure D-10). Radar shows target on the cold side. HUD TD box is above the waterline. Excessive or late lag pursuit can cause overshoot.

![Figure D-10. Lag Pursuit](AAM-2_Intercepts_page_18.jpeg)


### Closure

Closure (Vc) is the angular velocity between aircraft, displayed on the radar in knots. Vc changes with AA (decreasing AA decreases Vc, increasing AA increases Vc). The target/fighter speed ratio matters.  If the target is faster, a hotter intercept is needed (Figure D-11). If the fighter is faster, a colder intercept is possible.

![Figure D-11. Closure](AAM-2_Intercepts_page_19.jpeg)


### Questions

(Refer to Figure D-12)

Given fighter heading 135°, find:

* AA
* CATA

To gain closure, fly a _______ curve.

For quickest kill, fly:

1. lead pursuit to 10 nm, then pure pursuit
2. CATA all the way
3. offset until target is 50° right, then lead pursuit
4. offset until the pure pursuit curve

![Figure D-12. Question Diagram](AAM-2_Intercepts_page_20.jpeg)

a. left
b. right

What are two characteristics of a target on CATA?

What is the drift pattern for targets not on CATA?

How does a target on the nose drift (except H aspect)?

### Answers

1. AA = 16L
   CATA = 20° right
   Target Heading = 010°
   Target Airspeed = 520 knots
   Fighter TAS = 465 knots
   Vc = 870 knots
2. Lead pursuit
3. CATA all the way to the kill
4. a. left
5. Straight down the radar display (constant ATA), maintains constant AA
6. Drift away from CATA
7. Always drifts cold

### Medium Altitude Intercepts

#### Intercept Types (Figure D-13)

Two basic intercept types exist:

* **Cut-off/Collision Course:**  Minimizes time to kill.
* **Stern Conversion:** Used when cut-off is not possible, e.g., for identification.

Combining both creates a front MRM attack with stern reattack option.

![Figure D-13. Intercept Types](AAM-2_Intercepts_page_23.jpeg)

**Note:** Following discussions assume a single, co-speed, nonmaneuvering target unaware of the fighter.

#### Approach Quadrants (Figure D-14)

Four approach quadrants influence intercept execution:

* **Head-on:** 16 - H aspect
* **Front Quarter:** 12 - 15 aspect
* **Beam:** 7 - 11 aspect
* **Stern:** T - 6 aspect

![Figure D-14. Approach Quadrants](AAM-2_Intercepts_page_24.jpeg)


#### Cut-off/Collision Course Intercept

This is the quickest intercept.  Determine CATA using: `180° - AA = CATA`. Turn to place target on CATA.  Aspect angle and azimuth remain constant on CATA. Outside 1.2 aero, center the MRM steering dot in ASE circle for CATA. At 1.2 aero, the steering dot transitions to missile-to-target steering.  At 10 seconds to go, the dot provides pure pursuit.  While easy, collision course intercepts are not always possible.

#### Stern Conversions

If collision course is not feasible, perform a stern conversion to develop turning room and close for ID/firing position.  Three types exist: horizontal, combination, and vertical.

##### Horizontal

Flown nearly level with the target.

**Advantages:**  Simple turning room interpretation, easier no-lockon tracking, easier night/IMC flight.

**Disadvantages:**  Fighter is more visible, requires large turning room (8-10 nm).

**General Parameters:**  Sufficient turning room until pure pursuit, 100-200 knot speed advantage until rollout, 50-100 knots Vc at rollout within 9000 feet.

###### Head-on Horizontal Intercept (Figure D-15)

Starts with 16 - H aspect.  Requires more maneuvering for turning room. Offset 40-50° cold of CATA, counterturn to maintain azimuth until pure pursuit at: 15 AA at 20 nm, 14 AA at 15 nm, or 13 AA at 10 nm.  Later acquisition requires more aggressive maneuvering.

![Figure D-15. Head-on Horizontal Intercept](AAM-2_Intercepts_page_26.jpeg)

**Horizontal Pursuit Curve:**

* 13 AA at 30 nm
* 13 AA at 20 nm
* 13 AA at 15 nm
* 13 AA at 10-12 nm

###### Front Quarter Horizontal Intercept (Figure D-16)

Flown from 12 - 15 aspect. Existing turning room must be managed.  Place target on CATA until intersecting pure pursuit curve, then go pure pursuit (e.g., lockon shows 14R AA at 35 nm – put target on CATA [40°L], go pure pursuit at 15 nm).  Once on CATA, turn toward target to go pure, then reverse turn direction to maintain pure pursuit until dead astern.

![Figure D-16. Front Quarter Horizontal Intercept](AAM-2_Intercepts_page_28.jpeg)

###### Beam Horizontal Intercept (Figure D-17)

Flown from 7 - 11 aspect. Requires chase-down.  Accelerate to 200 knot speed advantage, displace target 50-55° hot, counterturn to maintain azimuth, go pure pursuit at 5-10 nm.

![Figure D-17. Beam Horizontal Intercept](AAM-2_Intercepts_page_29.jpeg)

###### Stern Horizontal Intercept

Flown from T - 6 aspect. Similar to beam horizontal, but displace target less (72 AA hot), accelerate, and establish pure pursuit at 3-5 nm. Airspeed is primary closure method.


##### Conversion Pursuit Guide (Figure D-18)

Aids in determining turning room. Sufficient turning room exists for immediate pure pursuit at points shown. For horizontal stern conversion, turning room lies along a line 10 nm offset from the target's projected path.

![Figure D-18. Conversion Pursuit Guide](AAM-2_Intercepts_page_30.jpeg)

##### Pure Pursuit Conversion Turn

Based on range, aspect, and Vc for rollout at target's six within 9000 feet with positive Vc.  If aspect/Vc is higher, lag the target. If lower, fly lead pursuit until reaching a reference point, then pure pursuit.

**Conversion Turn:**

| Range | Aspect | Vc      |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 7 nm  | 12     | 800-900 |
| 6 nm  | 10     | 700-800 |
| 5 nm  | 9      | 600-700 |
| 4 nm  | 7      | 500-600 |
| 3 nm  | 5      | 400-500 |
| 2 nm  | 2      | 200-300 |
| 1 nm  | T      | 100     |


##### Combination

Combines horizontal and vertical turning room (chandelle or slice).

**Advantages:**  Keeps fighter off target's horizon.

**Disadvantage:**  Difficult at night/IMC.

Typically uses 5000-10,000 feet vertical separation. Less horizontal offset is needed.  Maintain Vc advantage, rollout within 9000 feet with positive Vc.


**Combination Pursuit Guide:**

| AA   | Range |
|------|-------|
| 17   | 40    |
| 16   | 20    |
| 15   | 15    |
| 14   | 10    |


###### Head-on Combination Intercept (Figure D-19)

Similar to head-on horizontal. Displace target 30-50° cold of CATA (depending on vertical offset), establish 5000-10,000 feet vertical separation, counterturn to maintain offset, and establish pure pursuit at appropriate aspect/range.

![Figure D-19. Head-on Combination Intercept](AAM-2_Intercepts_page_32.jpeg)


###### Front Quarter Combination Intercept (Figure D-20)

Similar to front quarter horizontal.

![Figure D-20. Front Quarter Combination Intercept](AAM-2_Intercepts_page_33.jpeg)


###### Beam/Stern Combination Intercept (Figure D-21)

Similar to their horizontal counterparts.  Airspeed advantage is important.


![Figure D-21. Beam Combination Intercept](AAM-2_Intercepts_page_34.jpeg)


##### Vertical

Uses only vertical turning room (low to high or high to low).

**Advantages:**  Harder for target to see, high to low provides maximum energy advantage, low to high may mask fighter from radar.

**Disadvantages:**  Difficult high to low tally, potential square corner (high to low), energy depletion (low to high), difficult no-lockon flight.

**Desired Parameters:**  >10,000 feet vertical offset, early tally (8-10 nm), pure pursuit at 30° antenna elevation/depression, rollout within 9000 feet with 50-100 knots Vc.


###### Head-on Vertical Intercept (Figure D-22)

Maximize aspect angle (near 180°) and achieve desired vertical offset. Fly CATA until 30° antenna elevation/depression, then pure pursuit.  Modulate power for energy control during rollout (high to low) or use afterburner (low to high). Front quarter vertical is similar.

![Figure D-22. Head-on Vertical Intercept](AAM-2_Intercepts_page_36.jpeg)

##### Medium Altitude Intercept Summary

Two basic intercept types: cut-off and stern conversion. Collision course is easier but forms part of every stern conversion. Table D-1 summarizes the three stern conversion types.

| Aspect Angle | Intercept Geometry                                 | Altitude Differential | Pure Pursuit                                   |

### Intercept Steps, Flow, and Adjustments

**Intercept Flow:**

1. **Radar Setup/Search:** Disciplined setup and search plan.
2. **Find Target/Lock On:** Sample, BRA call, 3D view.
3. **Determine Intercept Geometry:** Cut-off or stern conversion.
4. **Maneuver:** Turning room, collision course, altitude offset, airspeed.
5. **Endgame:** MRM shot and/or stern conversion for ID/short range engagement.
6. **Early Tally:**  Visual acquisition aids maneuvering.

**Intercept Flow Summary:**

* Radar setup/search
* Find target/lock on
* BRA call
* Develop 3D view
* Determine intercept geometry
* Maneuver for turning room, collision course, altitude offset, and airspeed
* Endgame

#### Radar Setup/Search

Radar setup and search are complementary. The plan depends on the scenario, radar capabilities, modes, and preference.

**Range:** Cover expected threat range (intelligence, GCI, or area of responsibility). Consider threat parameters (size, altitude, speed).

**Elevation Scan:**  4 or 6 bar are common. More bars increase frame time.

**Azimuth (AZ):**  Cover required airspace.  60° AZ sweep covers 60 nm at 60 nm range.  Adjust as needed for different ranges.

**Acquisition Symbols:**  Initially set to briefed range/altitude.  Without GCI, set short of expected target acquisition range. With GCI, lead GCI range by 3-5 nm. Adjust as target range decreases.


**Altitude Coverage:**  Search expected threat altitudes. Coverage depends on acquisition symbol placement and bar scan. Search extreme altitudes first.  Having a plan is crucial.


#### Find Target/Lock On

Wait for two hits before locking on to avoid "birds".  Use frame store to identify true targets.

**Lock-on Techniques:**

1. Place acquisition symbol slightly closer than target, use TDC/full action for mini-raster lock-on (lead the target).
2. Place acquisition symbol over target, then command lock-on.

Avoid locking on during turns.


#### BRA(A) Call

Standardized format for reporting target position, relative or magnetic.

* **B:** Bearing (magnetic or relative)
* **R:** Range (nm)
* **A:** Altitude
* **(A):** Aspect Angle

Example (Figure D-23): "Jester 21, group (contact), one five zero, twenty, twenty-one thousand, flanking north."  Search radar example: "Jester 21, hit, one five zero, twenty, medium."


![Figure D-23. BRA(A) Report](AAM-2_Intercepts_page_42.jpeg)

#### Develop Three-Dimensional View

Understand the radar display information. Two intercept objectives: establish collision course for front aspect weapons, or build turning room for stern conversion. Use target TAS and AA to establish CATA. For stern conversion, use aspect, altitude, and range to determine turning room. Visualize the intercept from a "God's Eye" view (Figure D-24). The TSD provides a good "God's Eye" view.


![Figure D-24. Three-Dimensional View](AAM-2_Intercepts_page_43.jpeg)


#### Determine Intercept Geometry

After developing a 3D view, execute the desired intercept type, considering sun, clouds, elevation, threats, ROE, etc.  Maneuver for turning room or collision course at longer ranges to minimize maneuvering and deny early target tally. Go pure pursuit no later than 10 nm. Early visual tally simplifies maneuvering. Endgame consists of MRM shot and/or stern conversion for ID/short range engagement.


#### Maneuver to Make Adjustments to Intercept


##### Turning Room

Maneuvering for offset is like point-to-point navigation. Offset amount/direction depends on fighter position relative to the desired 10 nm horizontal offset (pure pursuit curve).  A 17 or H aspect with sufficient range might only require 40° cold offset. A 16 aspect at the same range might only need 30° offset (Figure D-25). At 20 nm, a 16 aspect already provides approximately 6 nm horizontal offset, while an H aspect provides none.  Closer proximity to desired offset requires less cold offset. Range is critical (Figure D-26).  Decreasing range requires more offset for horizontal turning room. Vertical displacement also helps.


![Figure D-25. Aspect Angle Versus Offset Required](AAM-2_Intercepts_page_45.jpeg)

![Figure D-26. Range Versus Offset](AAM-2_Intercepts_page_46.jpeg)

Initial maneuvering may not be perfect. Continuously evaluate turning room and adjust ATA. A "hot" intercept (insufficient turning room) requires higher G at endgame.  A "cold" intercept (too much turning room) results in excessive range at rollout (Figure D-27).


![Figure D-27. Turning Room Adjustment](AAM-2_Intercepts_page_47.jpeg)


##### Pure Pursuit (Figure D-28)

With sufficient turning room, pure pursuit converts to the target's stern. In VMC, go pure pursuit no later than 10 nm for stealth and early tally. At night/IMC, continue offsetting inside 10 nm if needed. Going pure early reduces offset without generating significant turn until short range.


![Figure D-28. Pure Pursuit Timing](AAM-2_Intercepts_page_48.jpeg)



##### Airspeed (Figure D-29)

Aim for positive overtake at rollout.  Figure D-29 shows recommended fighter airspeeds at "go pure" point, relative to target KTAS.  Set these speeds no later than the pure pursuit point.


![Figure D-29. Fighter Speed Advantage Versus Vertical Position](AAM-2_Intercepts_page_49.jpeg)


##### Fast Target

Fast targets (Mach 1.1+) complicate stern conversion. Offset earlier for lateral turning room. Increase cold offset due to higher closure. Match target airspeed by pure pursuit point to prevent negative Vc at rollout. Go pure pursuit at 14-15 AA due to high line of sight rates. Expect higher Vc and shorter stern weapon envelopes. Consider MRMs if outside SRM parameters.


##### Slow Target

Slow targets have small radar returns and low speeds, often at low altitude. High aspect approach may be necessary for front aspect MRM. VID may be difficult before minimum weapon range. For stern conversion, offset at normal range or later, attempt look-up (if altitude permits).  Radar lock may be difficult unless initial AA is 16-H. Expect multiple reacquisitions. Target moves slowly down the display, Vc is mostly from fighter, and AA decreases slowly. Increase cold offset. Go pure pursuit inside 10 nm due to low line of sight. Expect high stern closure at tactical airspeeds.



##### Vc Control

This table shows range vs. Vc for co-speed horizontal intercepts:


| Range | Aspect | Vc      |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 6 nm  | 10     | 700-800 |
| 5 nm  | 9      | 600-700 |
| 4 nm  | 7      | 500-600 |
| 3 nm  | 5      | 400-500 |
| 2 nm  | 2      | 200-300 |
| 1 nm  | T      | 100     |


If Vc is high, lag the target. If Vc is low, lead the target. Modulate power for small, momentary Vc adjustments.



##### Typical Intercept

**Phases:**

1. **Search:** 80 nm range, 4/6 bar el scan, 120° sweep, frame store 1. Use interleaved PRF patiently. Keep acquisition symbols short.  Cover required airspace/altitude.  Overlap altitudes during search pattern. 60° sweep can reduce frame time if threat axis is known.
2. **Detection:** After target acquisition/confirmation, use 30°/60° azimuth bump for faster refresh rate. Keep acquisition symbols at least 5 nm short.
3. **Sample:** Determine intercept geometry, plan action, build SA. Repeated locks (≈5 seconds) for target parameters and ID. STT/TWS/highlight are options.
4. **Targeting:** Flight lead determines priority group, flight sorts within for final locks.
5. **Sanitize:** Periodically check around target during sampling. Adjust search pattern as needed.
6. **Sorting:**  After sanitizing and determining parameters, lock the correct target. Adhere to briefed final lock range for consistent radar pictures.  Sort as briefed (wingman on left takes left bandit, wingman takes trailers, single takes bandit on conversion side). For lead/trail, lock the trailer.
7. **Intercept Geometry:** Position for desired geometry (cutoff: center dot, shoot; stern conversion: offset, monitor aspect/closure, go pure pursuit by 10 nm).
8. **Intercept Results:**
    * Attack undetected.
    * Mutual detection (neutral start).
    * Fighter undetected, target detected (defensive engagement or target kill).
    * Missed intercept.
9. **Separate:** Turn to egress heading, select guns, sanitize egress with radar, visually clear area, regain formation and mutual support. Switch to SRM, then MRM search after short range sanitize.



##### High Altitude Intercepts

High TAS/Mach and reduced turn performance make stern conversions impractical.  Head-on collision course at H aspect is preferred.


**Example Method:**

1. A/B climb to FL350, accelerate to 1.3M.
2. Increase aspect to H.
3. At ≈ Raero, center dot.
4. Shoot two missiles, 5 seconds apart.
5. At 15 miles/15 seconds missile TOF, bunt for next target.
6. Maintain target illumination during MRM TOF (may require high AoA and low speed).



##### Low Altitude Intercepts

**Challenges:** Reduced acquisition range (radar and visual), reduced missile envelopes, difficult gun employment, ground threat.


**Countermeasures:** Fly horizontal or limited vertical combination intercept.  Start conversion at 14 AA, gradually descend. Maintain speed ≥ target speed. Early tally is critical.  Use shadows as cues, anticipate ridge lines. Manage task saturation (six, lead, aircraft control).  Good crew coordination and directed responsibilities are crucial.


### Crew Coordination


#### Radar

Either crew member can control radar. WSO is normally primary operator, especially at low altitude when pilot focuses on terrain avoidance. Pilot controls radar during short range engagements using auto acquisition.  Non-controlling crew member monitors aircraft, clears for bandits, and manages flight deconfliction.


#### Commentary


##### Intercockpit

Two crew members increase capability but require more communication. Use key words, brevity terms, and established procedures. Communicate situation changes concisely.  Crew coordination improves with experience.


##### Intraflight

Minimize communication to essential information. Use brevity code (AFTTP 3-1). Only lead or intercepting aircraft acknowledge GCI calls.


#### Visual Lookout

Crucial for survival.  Clear immediate threat area first, search high and low, be disciplined.  Both crew members are responsible.  Perform periodic belly checks, especially before turns >90°.
