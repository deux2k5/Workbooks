### A/A Environment

Operating in the air-to-air environment is hazardous due to the dynamic nature of aerial combat.  The F-15E's two-person crew can be advantageous for task management and deviation detection.  Thorough preparation is crucial for safety and success.

#### Preparation

**Three Main Areas:**

1. Physiological Preparation
2. Systems Knowledge
3. Crew Coordination

##### Physiological Preparation

* **Physical:** Proper diet (at least 1200 calories daily, including breakfast) and hydration are essential for G tolerance and fatigue management. Regular exercise (aerobic and weight training) enhances physical readiness. 
* **Psychological:** Manage stress levels to optimize performance.  Thorough mission planning helps prepare for unusual events.  If overly stressed or fatigued, consider removing yourself from flight duties temporarily.
* **Pathological:** Do not fly while sick.  Seek medical evaluation and avoid self-medication.

##### Systems Knowledge

Thorough knowledge of aircraft systems and limitations is essential for safety.  Review F-15E Dash 1 restrictions and limitations, especially Section III concerning emergency procedures.

##### Crew Coordination

Effective crew coordination is vital for F-15E air-to-air operations.  

**Crew Brief Considerations:**

* Radar employment (initial control, handover procedures).
* Visual lookout responsibilities.
* Formation position and altitude block assignments.
* AAI, CMD, and weapons employment procedures.
* Radio communication (primary control, handover).
* Emergency handling.

Minimize intercockpit and radio communication by establishing clear procedures.

### Flight Tasks

**Four Phases:**

1. Beyond Visual Range (BVR)
2. BVR to Tally
3. Merge
4. Postmerge

#### Beyond Visual Range Task

**Focus:**  Preparation and situational awareness.

**Key Tasks:**

* Conduct thorough FENCE check (weapons, radar, CMD, fuel, RWR, G warm-up).
* Maintain briefed contract and visual contact within the flight.
* Use GCI/AWACS to build situational awareness.
* Execute crew-briefed game plan.
* Maintain flight path deconfliction.

**Typical Crew Roles:**

* WSO:  Initial radar and avionics control.
* Pilot:  Visual lookout, formation position, 6 o'clock coverage, down-track scan for tally/contrails.

#### BVR to Tally

**Focus:**  Refined situational awareness and transition to visual acquisition.

**Key Tasks:**

* Increase emphasis on flight path deconfliction.
* Typical role swap:
    * Pilot:  Takes radar control, focuses on HUD for tally acquisition.
    * WSO:  Assumes visual lookout, 6 o'clock coverage, and shot parameter monitoring.

**Important Considerations:**

* Time-out missiles, make kill calls, employ countermeasures (chaff/flares, IRCM).
* Maintain vigilance for bandit maneuvers (altitude stacks, splits, trailers).
* Avoid training rule violations.

#### Merge

**Focus:**  Visual combat and target engagement.

**Key Tasks:**

* Primary objective: Kill the bandit while maintaining situational awareness and safety.
* Visual lookout is paramount; do not assume other players see you.
* Maintain crew-briefed lookout procedures.
* Pilot focuses forward, WSO covers 6 o'clock and monitors floor transition.
* Disengage if task saturated or the situation becomes overly complex.

#### Postmerge

**Focus:**  Safe egress and situational awareness recovery.

**Key Tasks:**

* Quickly depart the merge area.
* Use short-range radar and visual scan to clear threats.
* Maintain crew-briefed lookout procedures.
* Extend in straight lines.
* Regain/maintain mutual support within flight, but prioritize deconfliction.
* Use GCI/AWACS and intraflight communication to rebuild situational awareness.

### Low Altitude Environment

Low altitude operations require additional considerations due to terrain proximity.

#### Low-to-High Conversions

* **Optimum Maneuver:** Chandelle, using vertical and horizontal offset to achieve low 6 o'clock without leaving the bandit's blind zone.
* **Terrain Avoidance:** Primary concern for the pilot, particularly during initial maneuver.
* **WSO Responsibilities:** Monitor terrain clearance, visual lookout, radar checks, 6 o'clock coverage, and assist with tally acquisition.
* **Potential Pitfalls:** Avoid squaring the corner at low altitude.  Maintain altitude awareness, even when seemingly high.

#### High-to-Low Conversions

* **Challenges:** Target terrain masking, camouflage, and radar lock loss during final conversion.
* **Key Focus:** Maintain terrain awareness, descent rate, speed, and nose position.
* **Crew Responsibilities:** WSO focuses on visual lookout and 6 o'clock coverage, both crew members monitor critical flight parameters.
* **Conversion Planning:** Complete most of the turn early, aim for slightly higher altitude than the target, maintain airspeed control.

#### Co-Altitude Intercepts

* **Challenges:** Bandit terrain masking.  Anticipate bandit movements based on terrain.
* **Crew Responsibilities:** Pilot focuses on terrain and tally acquisition, WSO covers 6 o'clock, radar, and visual lookout as needed.

#### Conversion Aborts

* **Avoid:** Pure high-to-low split-S maneuvers or rolls exceeding 135°.
* **Abort Criteria:** Exceed dive recovery parameters or uncomfortable situation.
* **Actions:** Roll wings level and recover.
* **WSO Responsibility:**  Be prepared to take control and avoid terrain if the pilot is incapacitated.

### Questions

1. Both crew members are responsible for terrain avoidance at low altitude.
    a. True
    b. False

2. Prebriefed crew coordination is unimportant in the dynamic air-to-air environment.
    a. True
    b. False

### Answers

1. a. True
2. b. False

## Trail Departure

### Purpose

Safely launch multiple aircraft when conditions preclude formation takeoff or rejoin.  Triggered by wet runways, crosswinds, configuration differences, low ceilings, or poor visibility.

### Responsibilities

* Flight Lead: Flies the published departure as briefed.
* Wingman:  Maintains aircraft control, flies the published departure, and maintains briefed separation from lead.  Uses instruments primarily, while WSO monitors and attempts radar lock on lead.

### Before Takeoff

* Review departure procedures.
* Set up navigation displays.
* Monitor clearance and controlling agency communications for restrictions.

#### Radar Setup

* **Mode:** A/A Master Mode (MM).
* **Range:** 10 nm.
* **Azimuth:** 60° sweep (consider 30° for straight departures).
* **Bar Scan:** 4/6.
* **Frame Store:** 1/2.
* **ACQ Symbols:**  Positioned at 1.5-2 nm.
* **Elevation:** 5-8° high, or field elevation and higher in altitude data block. **Note:** Reset after weight-off-wheels transmitter test.
* **AAT:** Use correct code (CC) mode and auto AAI set to PDT or STT. Assign unique squawks for easier identification in larger formations.  Last aircraft squawks Mode 3 Code XX00 (XX = first two digits of flight's Mode 3).  Verify AAI operation during taxi or as preceding aircraft take off.

### Takeoff

* Normal takeoff with 20-second spacing.

### After Takeoff

* Acquire radar lock on preceding aircraft (typically at 1.5-2 nm).
* Use manual or auto AAI to confirm correct target.
* Announce "TIED" once confirmed.  If omitted, lead makes required calls.
* Break lock as needed to clear flight path. Use AAI for azimuth/range tracking.
* Accelerate to briefed climb airspeed and set prebriefed power setting.
* Monitor closing velocity (Vc) for airspeed control.

### Maintaining Trail

* Use small heading changes to maintain 0° aspect angle (T) during constant heading segments.
* Offset slightly to avoid jetwash.
* Strong crosswinds can cause offset; cross-check TD box movement and compare lead's heading with SID.
* Anticipate turns.  For 30° bank, allow 5° target drift per mile of trail (Figure D-1).
* Use lead or lag pursuit to maintain spacing while adhering to SID restrictions.

**Figure D-1:** Sync points for 30° bank trail.

![Figure D-1. Sync Points for 30° Bank Trail](AAM-3_Air-to-Air_Mission_Tasks_page_20.jpeg)

* Maintain sync line for zero Vc. Drift left for negative Vc (increased range), drift right for positive Vc (decreased range).
* Power/airspeed adjustments are least desirable for spacing control due to accordion effect on following aircraft.
* Fly the SID precisely, maintain altitude separation, and make all calls.

### Loss of Radar Contact

* Immediately notify lead.
* Continue flying the SID.
* Flight lead calls turns (30° bank).
* Call passing each 5000 ft altitude increment (climb/descent) with heading.
* Call all heading/altitude changes.
* Maintain 1000 ft altitude separation on level-off.

**Common Causes:** Deviation from SID, incorrect radar pointing.

### Questions

1.  The recommended method for radar lock during trail departure is to use supersearch.
    a. True
    b. False

2.  Without radar contact, call altitudes every __________ feet and all heading changes.
    a. 1000
    b. 3000
    c. 5000
    d. 10,000

### Answers

1.  b. False
2.  c. 5000

## Air Refueling

### Mission Preparation

* Obtain:
    * Tanker call sign, track, altitude block, offload, frequencies, ARCT.
    * ARIP and ARCP position, coordinates, and TACAN fixes.

### Ground Operations

* Verify aircraft is air refuelable.
* Check slipway door operation and READY/receptacle lights.

### En Route

* Set radar to search tanker's altitude block.
* Maintain briefed formation position.
* Obtain tanker's Mode 3 IFF for AAI identification.
* Set master arm to SAFE and correct altimeter setting.

### Rendezvous Geometry

* **Two Methods:** Point parallel and fighter turn-on.
* **Key Considerations:**
    * Utilize GCI but monitor geometry for efficiency.
    * Use radar and A/A TACAN to detect deviations.
    * Maintain altitude separation until visual.
    * Complete hot armament safety check before entering tanker's lethal envelope.
    * Wingman maintains formation position to avoid midair collision.

#### Point Parallel (Figure D-2)

* Used when the tanker is not refueling and is positioned at the ARCP.
* Establish radio contact before ARIP (EMCON 2 normally).
* Exchange DME/radial information once contact is established.
* Obtain clearance from tanker to depart ARIP.
* Maintain 1000 ft below tanker until visual.

![Figure D-2. Point Parallel Rendezvous](AAM-3_Air-to-Air_Mission_Tasks_page_25.jpeg)

#### Point Parallel Radar Depiction (Figure D-3)

* Lead tells tanker to turn at 26° azimuth/21 nm range.
* Tanker should be 34° left at 8 nm when halfway through the turn.
* Use checkpoints to maintain proper geometry.

![Figure D-3. Point Parallel Rendezvous Radar Depiction](AAM-3_Air-to-Air_Mission_Tasks_page_26.jpeg)

#### Point Parallel Rendezvous Data (Table D-1)

| Checkpoint | Range (nm) | Azimuth (°) | Time (min:sec) |
|------------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| A          | 21         | 26          | 0:00           |
| B          | 17         | 30          | 0:30           |
| C          | 8          | 34          | 1:30           |
| D          | 3          | 0           | 2:00           |

**Note:** Checkpoints assume tanker at 275 KCAS/FL280 and fighter at 310 KCAS/FL250.

#### Adjustments:

* Range less than checkpoint: Reduce power, tell tanker to accelerate, perform slight check turn away.
* Range greater than checkpoint: Increase power, turn slightly towards tanker.

#### Airspeed Effects:

* Increasing fighter airspeed to 350 KCAS reduces rollout distance by 2 nm (rollout ≈1 nm behind tanker).

#### Rendezvous Overrun

* Tanker/receiver transmits warning and initiates overrun procedures.
* Receiver: Passes 1000 ft below tanker, decelerates to 290 KCAS (or buffet onset), maintains heading.
* Tanker:  Accelerates to 355 KIAS (385 KCAS) or Mach 0.90 (whichever is lower), maintains heading.
* Once visually clear, receiver notifies tanker, who decelerates to refueling airspeed and normal closure resumes.

#### Prerefueling Checks

* Perform "BRITTS" check:
    * Beacon
    * Radar
    * IFF
    * TACAN
    * TEWS
    * Slipway
* Ensure forward firing ordnance is safe and emissions-emitting systems are in standby (EMIS LMT available).
* Set up fuel panel as briefed.
* Acknowledge boom operator radio check (EMCON option 1).

### Postair Refueling

* Complete postair refueling checklist.
* Verify fuel quantity and distribution.
* Maintain briefed formation.
* Mentally transition to next mission phase.
* Reset switches, prepare for FENCE check.

### After Landing

* Document any air refueling system discrepancies.
* Record fuel offload in AFTO Form 781.
* Open slipway door for maintenance inspection.
