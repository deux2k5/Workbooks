## Text

This lesson introduces GCI/AWACS systems, procedures, brevity codes, separation/termination criteria, and maneuvering categories for effective intercept operations.

### GCI/AWACS Capabilities and Limitations

**Ground Control Intercept (GCI):** Provides radar surveillance, threat warning, fighter/tanker rendezvous, and intercept control.  It's a crucial link to command authority, providing situational awareness, intelligence, and command decisions.

**Figure D-1:**  Illustrates a Tactical Air Control System (TACS), a mobile command and control system using manual and automated radar sites.

![Figure D-1. Tactical Air Control System](AAM-4_Ground_Controlled_Intercepts_page_7.jpeg)

**Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS):**  A mobile GCI platform based on a modified E-3 aircraft, providing radar coverage where ground sites are unavailable or less effective.

**GCI Operations:**  Procedures are similar for GCI and AWACS. Both utilize long-range radars, serve as a link to command, and direct aircraft based on the air order of battle.  Effective GCI/AWACS interaction requires clear communication and feedback during training and debriefs.

**GCI Mission:**

* **Stateside:** Detect and identify aircraft entering U.S. airspace (air defense).
* **Overseas:** Assist in Offensive Counter Air (OCA) tasks (sweep, force protection) and Defensive Counter Air (DCA) tasks (force/base protection).

**GCI Procedures:**  AFI 11-214 provides standardized procedures for air-to-air and air-to-surface operations and training, including GCI/aircrew interface and a glossary of terms.

### GCI/AWACS Comparison

#### Manual Radars

* **Tactical Air Control System (TACS):**  Mobile, adaptable system using hardened sites and mobile radars (e.g., TPS 75 planar array).
* **Forward Air Control Post (FACP):** Most forward TACS component, located ≈50 miles from the FEBA.
* **Control and Reporting Center (CRC):**  Located ≈200 miles from the FEBA, houses command authorities.

**Manual Radar Characteristics:**

* Range:  ≈240 nm (line-of-sight limitations apply).
* Beam width:  ≈1.5°.
* Tracking:  Azimuth and range primarily, altitude resolution limited.
* Resolution:  Good target discrimination at close range (workable to 1 nm), inherent lag due to antenna rotation.
* Communication: Extensive UHF/VHF/HF links to command authority.

**Advantages:**

* Mobile and adaptable.
* Effective at the merge.

**Disadvantages:**

* Limited range.
* Limited low-level coverage.
* Susceptible to electronic countermeasures (ECM).

#### Automated Radars (SOCC/ROCC)

* Located at major command centers (e.g., Sector Operating Control Centers (SOCCs), Region Operating Control Centers (ROCCs)).
* Receive and display data from multiple sources (manual radars, AWACS).
* Provide high-level command and control, regional air picture, threat evaluation, and air-to-air control.
* Examples:
    * **SOCCs:** Huntress (Griffiss AFB), Bigfoot (McChord AFB)
    * **ROCCs:** Top Rock (Elmendorf AFB), Oak Grove/Cypress (Tyndall AFB)

**Automated Radar Characteristics:**

* Extensive coverage based on networked manual sites.
* Computerized tracking and display, less effective for close-in control.
* Digital data links, HAVE QUICK capable.

**Advantages:**

* Long range.
* Command and control capabilities.

* Provides radar coverage where ground sites are unavailable or have limited effectiveness.
* Operates at ≈30,000 feet MSL.
* Can detect:
    * Fighter-sized targets (low altitude):  >200 nm
    * Bomber-sized targets (high altitude):  >300 nm

**AWACS Radar Characteristics:**

* Pulse/pulse Doppler radar with low ground interference.
* Enhanced ECM resistance (sidelobe suppression).
* Large, computer-generated symbols on display, limiting close-in control.

**AWACS Communication:**

* ADF, secure voice, data link, HAVE QUICK, HF.
* Limited number of radios available for GCI.

**Advantages:**

* Long-range surveillance.
* Mobility.
* Low-level coverage.
* ECM resistance.

**Disadvantages:**

* Limited merge performance.
* Limited communication capacity.
* Aircraft/computer dependent.

3. Forward Air Control Post (FACP).
4. ≈50 miles from the FEBA.
5. Large, computer-generated symbols limit close-in fighter control.

### Aircrew/Weapons Director Responsibilities

**Shared Assumptions:**

* Knowledge of wartime authentication procedures.
* Understanding of theater and regional airspace control.
* Awareness of current threat tactics and capabilities.
* Familiarity with states of alert, readiness/warning systems, ROE/TR.
* Knowledge of communication/control systems and weapons capabilities/limitations.

**Commit Authority:**

* Subject to OPORDS/OPLANs, command authority, ROE, commit criteria, and force commander direction.
* Flight lead can commit for self-defense or during WD saturation.
* WD verifies target appropriateness and assists.

**"SKIP IT" Call:**

* Directive command from WD to disengage.
* Aircrew complies unless it jeopardizes flight safety ("UNABLE" response).

#### Continuum of Control (Figure D-2)

**Five Levels:**

1. Close
2. Tactical
3. Broadcast
4. Advisory
5. Autonomous

![Figure D-2. Continuum of Control](AAM-4_Ground_Controlled_Intercepts_page_16.jpeg)

**Transition:** Occurs dynamically based on situational awareness (SA).

#### WD Responsibilities (All Levels):

* Provide situation brief (PICTURE).
* Define commit objective (KILL or ID).
* Provide threat information (numbers, formation, altitude, heading, speed).
* Commit fighters to highest priority target.
* Monitor intercept/engagement, provide vectors/bearing/range if contact is lost.
* Monitor for new targets, skip current engagement if necessary.

#### Aircrew Responsibilities (All Levels):

* Position aircraft/flight for mission accomplishment.
* Acknowledge target information.
* Notify WD if target contact is lost.
* Report new contacts (BRA report).
* Report essential elements of information (EEI).
* Report mission results.
* Advise WD of fighter status.
* Comply with "SKIP IT" unless it jeopardizes flight safety.

#### Close Control

* Highest level of WD control.
* Can involve detailed vectors or specific altitude/speed/heading instructions.
* Initiated by mission requirements or aircrew request ("GO CLOSE CONTROL" or "VECTORS").
* WD provides vectors based on briefed tactics or adjustments based on armament, environment, target altitude, or ROE.
* Aircrew complies with WD directives or requests "VECTORS."

**Close Control Dialogue Example:**

* Fighter call sign.
* Objective (KILL or ID) – only repeated if it changes.
* Target position (bearing/distance) -  use "ESTIMATE" if uncertain, include BULLSEYE/grid reference if applicable.
* Target altitude (feet or AFTTP 3-1 bands).
* Flight size and formation (e.g., "HEAVY, LINE ABREAST").
* Target heading/maneuver (cardinal directions, clear tactical descriptions).
* Threat type/role (if known).
* Other observations (e.g., "SLOW," "FAST").

#### Tactical Control

* Utilizes both aircrew and WD SA.
* WD provides target information and commit objective, but not vectors.
* Standard for operational and training missions.

**Tactical Control Dialogue Example:**

```
FIGHTER: "DRAGNET, EAGLE 01"
GCI: "ROGER, EAGLE 01, WHAT STATE?"
FIGHTER: "EAGLE 01 AS FRAGGED" or "EAGLE 01 4 RADAR, 2 HEAT, GUN, 20 MINUTES"
GCI: "EAGLE 01, DRAGNET, KILL, ZERO NINE ZERO, FIFTY, MEDIUM, NORTH"
FIGHTER: "AUTHENTICATE ALPHA BRAVO"
GCI: "AUTHENTICATION CHARLIE"
FIGHTER: "EAGLE 01, COMMITTED, ZERO EIGHT ZERO, FORTY-FIVE, TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND" (BRA Report)
FIGHTER: "EAGLE 01, BANDIT BANDIT, FOX THREE"
GCI: "EAGLE 01, ADDITIONAL BOGEY, ONE TWO ZERO, SIXTY-FIVE, BEAMING"
FIGHTER: "EAGLE 01"
FIGHTER: "EAGLE 01, SPLASH, BOGEY DOPE"
```

**Key Communication Principles:**

* Aircrew:  Communicate concisely to support everyone's SA, keep WD informed.
* WD: Keep aircrews informed, listen actively.

#### Broadcast Control

* Covert, saturated, or low SA environment.
* Informative, not directive.
* Targets referenced to designated locations/grid systems, not specific aircrews.
* Aircrews call "COMMIT" with reference point to improve coordination.

**Broadcast Control Information Priority:**

1. Track designation (e.g., BANDIT, BOGEY, GROUP).
2. Reference system (BULLSEYE, geographic reference, grid name).
3. Bearing/range from reference to target.
4. Target heading.
5. Estimated target number (if applicable).

**Example:** "BANDIT; BULLSEYE; TWO FIVE ZERO, TWENTY; NORTHWEST; HEAVY"

**Figure D-3:**  Illustrates broadcast control using a grid reference system.

![Figure D-3. Grid Reference](AAM-4_Ground_Controlled_Intercepts_page_21.jpeg)

#### Advisory Control

* Used when WD loses radar contact, shuts down radar, experiences ECM, or fighters are out of range.
* WD monitors radio communications, relays information, and maintains situational awareness.
* WD transmits "MIDNIGHT, MIDNIGHT" to indicate advisory control.
* Aircrews call "CONTACT," "COMMIT," and "ENGAGED" to keep WD and other fighters informed.

#### Autonomous Control

* Occurs when communication with controlling agency is lost or degraded.
* Not preplanned.
* Both aircrew and WD attempt to re-establish communications.
* Make blind calls until communication is restored.

#### Control Considerations

**Check-in Procedures:**

* Flight lead contacts GCI net with call sign, deviations/aborts.
* WD authenticates, provides working frequency, situation brief (PICTURE), and IFF/SIF checks.
* Aircrew states armament status ("AS FRAGGED" or specific missile types and quantities, "GUN" if sufficient).
* Aircrew reports fuel state in minutes of time on station.

**Example:**

```
Flight Lead: "DRAGNET, BRUTE 21, 160 AT 60 OFF SEYMOUR JOHNSON"
GCI: "ROGER BRUTE 21, DRAGNET HAS RADAR CONTACT. WHAT STATE?"
Flight Lead: "BRUTE 21, LEAD HAS 4 RADAR, 4 HEAT, GUN, PLUS 50 MINUTES"
```

**Return to Base (RTB) Procedures:**

* Aircrew contacts controlling agency with call sign and recovery base.
* WD provides recovery instructions (base status, in-flight reports, minimum risk procedures), hands off to receiving agency.

### Questions

1. Which control level provides the highest degree of control?
2. How does tactical control differ from close control?
3. Which control level uses designated locations/grid systems for target information?
4. When is advisory control used?
5. How does WD indicate advisory control?
6. When is autonomous control used?

### Answers

1. Close control.
2. Tactical control provides target information and commit objectives, but not vectors.
3. Broadcast control.
4. When WD loses radar, shuts down radar, experiences ECM, or fighters are out of range.
5. "MIDNIGHT, MIDNIGHT" transmission.
6. When communication with controlling agency is lost or degraded.

### Operational Brevity Code

**Purpose:** Convey complex messages concisely in tactical situations using succinct phrases or words.  Refer to AFTTP 3-1 for complete brevity code list (Appendix G in this workbook).

**Examples:**

* BENT: Identified system inoperative.
* BUZZER: Electronic communications jamming.
* FADED: Previous radar contact lost.
* GADGET: Fire control radar.
* HOLDING HANDS: Aircraft in visual formation.
* LOW: Target altitude below 10,000 feet AGL.
* SNAP: Request immediate vector to target.

**Brevity Code Dialogue Example:**

```
GCI: EAGLE 21 WHAT STATE?
(Translation: What ordnance/fuel do you have?)

Aircrew: EAGLE 21 IS WINCHESTER, BINGO, AND RTB!
(Translation: No radar/heat-seeking missiles/bullets, 5 minutes of fuel remaining, returning to base)
```

**Directive Commentary/Phrases:**

* Heading: "VECTOR XXX" (three digits).
* Altitude: "MAINTAIN FLIGHT LEVEL."
* Speed: "MAINTAIN MACH POINT X" (Mach number).
* Geometry: "CUTOFF" (fastest), "STERN" (behind target), "PURSUIT" (heading towards).
* Turn direction: Left or Right.

**Example:** "EAGLE 01, CONTACT, ZERO NINE ZERO, TWENTY-ONE, 33,000, BEAM, WEST"

### Questions

1. What is the purpose of the operational brevity code?
2. What does "CONTACT GORILLA LOW" mean? (Refer to Appendix G)

### Answers

1. To convey complex messages concisely in tactical environments.
2. Radar contact on a large force of unknown numbers and formation below 10,000 feet AGL.

### Air-to-Air Training Rules

#### Brief and Debrief Requirements

* Face-to-face briefings/debriefings are preferred.
* Telephonic briefings are acceptable alternatives.
* Airborne briefings are authorized in limited circumstances.
* Briefing topics:
    * Working area, scenario, tactics, training rules, "KNOCK-IT-OFF" criteria, alternate missions, rendezvous, emergencies.
* Debriefings: Critically assess mission execution, discuss WD/aircrew role adjustments.

#### Airspace

* Training conducted in designated airspace.
* Avoid lateral spillouts (joint WD/aircrew responsibility).
* Avoid vertical spillouts (aircrew responsibility).
* Supersonic flight only in designated areas.

#### Training Responsibilities

**WD Responsibilities:**

* Advise aircrews of potential hazards (unreported aircraft within 10 miles, bearing/range/heading/altitude).
* Inform aircrews if control level falls below broadcast control.
* Provide "CHECK FUEL" advisories.
* Advise on airspace boundaries, changes, weather, and system degrades.
* Make standard calls:
    * Vectors for activity setup.
    * Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA).
    * 10 nm range call from any merge.

**Aircrew Responsibilities:**

* Acknowledge WD airspace/safety calls.
* Remain within designated training area.

#### Training Rules

* Peacetime rules, procedures, and standards governing air-to-air training to ensure safety (distinct from Rules of Engagement).
* Found in AFI 11-214.

#### Separation of Aircraft

* **Vertical Separation:**  Hard altitudes/altitude blocks assigned. Minimum 1000 ft between blocks (500 ft below 5000 ft AGL).
* **Altitude Block Entry:** Permitted only if adversary is:
    * Beyond 10 nm.
    * Within 10 nm but not a conflict (based on SA).
    * In visual contact.
    * Altitude confirmed verbally and vertical separation maintained.

**"See and Avoid" Techniques:**

* Attacker losing sight: Maneuvers away from defender's last known position.
* Defender losing sight/SA: Maneuvers predictably.

**Minimum Range:**

* No maneuvering within minimum range (specified in MAJCOM/service directives).

#### Termination Criteria

* Based on AFI 11-214 and MAJCOM supplements.
* Examples:
    * Drift to area boundary.
    * Uninvolved aircraft entering the area.
    * Minimum altitude/cloud approach.
    * Reaching maneuvering limits.
    * Engaged aircraft starting air-to-surface delivery.
    * Attacker becoming defensive at low altitude.
    * Loss of situational awareness (SA).
    * Radio failure.
    * Any aircraft rocking its wings.
    * Achieving desired learning objectives.
    * Stalemate.
    * Developing dangerous situation.
    * Minimum/BINGO fuel reached.
    * Over-G.
    * "Knock-it-off" or "Terminate" call.

#### Terminate vs. Knock-It-Off

* **Terminate:**  Applies to an individual aircraft or flight.
* **Knock-it-off:**  Applies to all participants.
* **Safety Hazard:**  Anyone perceiving a safety hazard calls "KNOCK-IT-OFF." All participants cease maneuvering and acknowledge.
* **Individual Termination:**  Use "TERMINATE" followed by a wing rock (if safe) to stop a specific aircraft/flight.

### Questions

1. What is the preferred briefing/debriefing method?
