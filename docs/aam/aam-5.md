## Text

### Introduction

Air-to-air combat involves destroying the enemy while ensuring your survival. This might require employing BFM, which are not fixed maneuvers but rather adaptable combinations of rolls, turns, and accelerations. Success in BFM depends on:

* Forcing a reaction from the bandit.
* Predicting the bandit's next move.
* Maneuvering to achieve weapons parameters.
* Continuously assessing maneuver effectiveness and bandit reactions.

This process of "force, predict, and maneuver" helps achieve a kill or a tactical separation.

### BFM Mechanics and Definitions

BFM involves using aircraft handling skills to solve range, closure, aspect, and angle-off problems relative to another aircraft.

**Three BFM Tools:**

* **Roll:** Positions your lift vector, determines your plane of motion (POM), and helps maintain sight of the bandit.
* **Turn:** Used to reach weapons employment zones or evade enemy attacks. Optimum or maximum turns depend on the aircraft's angle of attack (AOA).
* **Acceleration:** Crucial for energy management. The F-15E accelerates best at 8-10 units AOA.

**Acceleration Considerations:**

* Maintain situational awareness (attitude, altitude, airspeed).
* Don't over-accelerate or waste time.
* Be aware of nose position to avoid losing energy during recovery.

### BFM and Aircraft Feel

Successful energy management requires understanding your aircraft's envelope and developing a "feel" for its performance and energy state. AoA control is essential.

**Figure D-1:** Shows key AOA values for maximizing the Strike Eagle's performance.

![Figure D-1. BFM AOA Guide](AAM-5_OBFM_page_9.jpeg)

### Geometry

#### Positional Geometry

Describes one aircraft's position relative to another using:

* Range: Distance between aircraft.
* Aspect Angle: Attacker's position relative to target's tail (0° = tail aspect, 180° = head aspect).
* Angle Off (HCA): Angle between attacker's and defender's longitudinal axes.  Equal to aspect angle when attacker points at defender.

**Figure D-2:** Illustrates range, aspect angle, and angle off.

![Figure D-2. Range, Aspect Angle, and Angle Off](AAM-5_OBFM_page_10.jpeg)

#### Attack Geometry (Figure D-3)

Three pursuit courses:

* **Lead Pursuit:** Attacker's nose points ahead of the target.
* **Lag Pursuit:** Attacker's nose points behind the target.
* **Pure Pursuit:** Attacker's nose points directly at the target.

These geometries are three-dimensional and depend on the attacker's nose position and lift vector relative to the target:

* **In-plane:**  Pursuit course determined by nose position relative to the bandit's plane of motion.
* **Out-of-plane:** Pursuit course determined by where the lift vector will position the nose when re-entering the defender's plane of motion.

![Figure D-3. Pursuit Curves](AAM-5_OBFM_page_11.jpeg)

#### Weapon Employment Zone (WEZ)

Area around the adversary where you can employ ordnance. Size depends on:

* Ordnance type
* Airspeed
* Altitude
* Aspect angle
* Angle off
* Aircraft turn capability

#### Turning Room/Turn Circle

* **Turning Room:** Distance between aircraft, usable for acceleration/deceleration or turning into the turn circle. Exists both in and out of the adversary's plane of motion.
* **Turn Circle (Figure D-4):**  Mental projection of the defender's turn over time. Size varies with target TAS and G loading.

**Visual Cues for Entering Turn Circle:**

* Forward line-of-sight (LOS) movement of the defender.
* Constant or decreasing aspect angle.

![Figure D-4. Turn Circle](AAM-5_OBFM_page_13.jpeg)

#### Control Zone (Figure D-5)

Position along the bandit's turn circle from which you can maintain pressure. Allows rapid movement into a WEZ with an energy advantage or bandit error.

**Control Zone Limits:**

* **Inner Limit:** Allows reaction time for bandit maneuvers, gunshots, or maintaining minimum range/separation.
* **Outer Limit:**  Provides more margin for aspect, angle off, and closure but risks losing pressure on the bandit.

**Figure D-5:**  Shows a generic control zone for F-15E vs. F-15E BFM. Adjust based on adversary capabilities.

![Figure D-5. The Control Zone](AAM-5_OBFM_page_14.jpeg)

### Offensive Maneuvers

#### Lead Reposition Maneuver (Figures D-6 & D-7)

* **Purpose:** Increase closure, decrease range, reduce angle off.
* **Execution:**  Increase bank angle, pull towards the inside of the bandit's turn circle, over-rotate for increased radial G, establish lead pursuit, reduce G and accelerate.

**Considerations:**

* Avoid overshooting by making several small lead repositions.
* Excessive lead repositioning can telegraph a low energy state to the bandit.

![Figure D-6. Lead Reposition](AAM-5_OBFM_page_15.jpeg)
![Figure D-7. Lead Reposition, Cockpit View](AAM-5_OBFM_page_16.jpeg)

#### Lag Reposition Maneuver (Figures D-8 & D-9)

* **Purpose:**  Control excessive closure.
* **Execution:**  If closure is manageable, use power reduction and/or G onset.  For more severe closure, roll lift vector out of bandit's plane of motion, pull to out-of-plane lag pursuit, monitor bandit's track on canopy, reorient lift vector and pull back into plane of motion.

**Considerations:**

* Use small, multiple lag repositions to maintain pressure.
* Avoid flying too high above the bandit or failing to recognize their lift vector, which can force you out of the control zone.
* Recognize that lag pursuit reduces aspect but increases angle off, giving the bandit acceleration opportunities.

![Figure D-8. Lag Reposition](AAM-5_OBFM_page_17.jpeg)
![Figure D-9. Lag Reposition, Cockpit View](AAM-5_OBFM_page_18.jpeg)

#### Quarter Plane (Figures D-10 & D-11)

* **Purpose:**  Last-ditch maneuver to maintain nose-tail separation and offensive advantage in high angle-off, high aspect, high closure, short-range situations.
* **Execution:**  Roll at least 90° away from the bandit's plane of motion, reduce power to idle, pull with high G to control aspect and closure, reorient lift vector and pull toward control zone while reapplying power when safe.

**Considerations:**

* Late recognition can lead to overshoot and loss of advantage.
* Recommitting nose too low can allow the bandit to force a vertical overshoot.

### Offensive BFM

#### Objectives

* Kill the bandit.
* Maintain offensive advantage (energy and geometry).
* Separate before becoming neutral or defensive.

#### Offensive BFM Setups

* Altitude: Fight floor + 10,000' AGL.
* Airspeed: 480 KCAS.
* Formation: Line abreast at fight start range + 3000'.
* HUD Recording: Start at the "ready" call.
* Altitude:  Both aircraft strive for altitude + 500'.
* Airspeed: At least 400 KCAS to call "READY."
* Initial Maneuver: Lead checks flight 45° into the defender, who then performs a hard turn and attempts radar lock.
* Defender: Controls angle for a 4 aspect at the "fight's on" range.
* Offender: Maintains pure pursuit and calls range every 1000 ft.
* Fight Start: At briefed "fight's on" range, both aircraft should have setup airspeed (430 KCAS ± 10).
* Termination:  If setup parameters are not met.

#### Post-Fight Procedures:

* Deconflict, establish 350 KCAS mil power climb, and regain line abreast formation.
* Climb to altitude and accelerate to starting airspeed.
* Do not call "READY" below 400 KCAS.

#### Offensive BFM Areas:

* **Long Range BFM:** Outside the defender's projected turn circle.
* **Short Range BFM:** At or inside the defender's turn circle.

#### Long Range BFM (Figure D-12)

* Initial Problem: Range.  Must enter the bandit's turn circle.
* Goal: Fly to an offset point on the defender's turn circle, perform an offensive break turn to achieve a slight flight path overshoot behind the bandit.

**Entry Options:**

* **Lead Pursuit Entry:**  Increases aspect, HCA, and closure. Can lead to overshoot.  Suitable for quick engagements (low fuel/ordnance, superior bandit).
* **Pure Pursuit Entry:** Forces defender to turn, but allows bandit to build angle problems.  May work against inferior adversaries.
* **Lag Pursuit Entry (Figure D-14):** Aims behind the bandit, maximizes turning room without going out the back of the turn circle.  Avoid prolonged lag pursuit to maintain pressure.

![Figure D-14. Lag Entry](AAM-5_OBFM_page_25.jpeg)

**Entering the Turn Circle:**

* Visual Cues: Decreasing/stabilizing aspect angle, increasing bandit LOS rate.
* Vertical Turning Room: Use caution, avoid excessive vertical displacement.
* Displacement: Drive to where the bandit was at the start of their turn, adjust based on their turn radius.
* Offensive Break Turn: Accelerate to slightly above corner velocity (≈450 KCAS max), perform max rate turn upon entering the turn circle, aim for slight overshoot (no closer than one turn radius behind).

**Post-Break Turn:**

* Transition to short range BFM to reach the control zone.
* Potential for low aspect missile shots against inferior adversaries.

#### Short Range BFM

* Starts at or inside the turn circle, behind the bandit's 3/9 line.
* Objective: Control aspect, angle-off, and range while maneuvering towards a firing position.
* Entry: Similar to long range BFM, displace pursuit course based on bandit's break turn.

**Maneuvering Techniques (Figures D-15 & D-16):**

* Use canopy references to position bandit during lag maneuvers.
* When bandit's LOS rate increases, roll in-plane or to lead and pull to top of canopy bow/HUD.
* Employ weapons if within range.
* Perform multiple small maneuvers to conserve energy.

![Figure D-15. FCP Canopy Code](AAM-5_OBFM_page_29.jpeg)
![Figure D-16. RCP Canopy Code](AAM-5_OBFM_page_29.jpeg)

**Gunshot Considerations:**

* Quickest opportunity against poorly turning aircraft.
* Requires rapid BFM/gun sight solutions.
* Against similar adversaries, maintain lag, perform slight overshoot, and pull into lead pursuit for setup.
* Control overtake to prevent gross overshoot.
* Use out-of-plane maneuvering or power modulation for overtake control.
* Modulate power against performance-limited bandits to maintain an energy advantage.

#### Offensive BFM Errors

* **Misjudging Bandit's Initial Turn:** Failing to control aspect if the bandit gets you ahead of the 3/9 line can lead to overshoot and defensive positioning.  Consider a neutral fight to regain the offensive.
* **Poor Power/Airspeed Control:**  Adjust power/G to match the bandit's turn performance and maintain desired LOS movement.
* **Excessive Repositioning:** Pulling nose off the bandit relaxes pressure and gives them options. Use small, precise lead/lag maneuvers to maintain pressure while controlling aspect, angle off, and closure.
* **Failure to Employ Ordnance:**  Remember the goal is a quick kill. Prolonged BFM increases vulnerability.

#### Scissors (Figure D-17)

* Occurs when bandit attempts to reverse and force a slow-speed fight, often due to attacker's range/closure problems.

![Figure D-17. Scissors](AAM-5_OBFM_page_31.jpeg)

##### Flat Scissors

* Result of an in-plane overshoot.
* **Priorities:**
    * Stop forward velocity (idle power initially, then max AB to maintain pitch).
    * Pull to bandit's high 6 o'clock to regain 3/9 advantage.
* **Lift Vector Control:**  Crucial to avoid losing nose position and 3/9 advantage.
* **Early Reversal:** Use a lead turn at the next pass to reduce angle off and slow LOS, enabling better gunshots.
* **Low LOS Snapshot:**  May be necessary if bandit prevents LOS slowing.
* **Separation:** Consider separating if unable to win the slow-speed fight.

**Major Errors:**

* Not pulling parallel to horizon (increasing horizontal travel).
* Not pulling to bandit's six (excessive lateral separation).
* Losing nose position due to poor bank control.
* Not using an early reversal after gaining 3/9 advantage.

##### Rolling Scissors (Figure D-18)

* Occurs:
    * From out-of-plane overshoot.
    * Altitude differential at flat scissors initiation.
    * Defensive maneuver by a lower wing-loaded adversary.
* **Tendencies:**  Develops into a nose-low spiral if continued.
* **Winning Factors:**  Maneuverability and nose pointing ability.
* **Separation:** Easier than flat scissors if done early and properly (during roll down while bandit is pulling up).
* **Errors:** Similar to flat scissors, but requires overbanking for roll.

![Figure D-18. Rolling Scissors](AAM-5_OBFM_page_33.jpeg)

#### Separations (Figure D-19)

* **Objective:** Disengage safely before losing offensive position.
* **Initiation:**  Stop turning with the bandit, employ ordnance to force a reaction, unload and accelerate while maintaining bank to appear in lag pursuit, roll and pull to establish maximum HCA (150-180°) when at deep six.
* **Reacquisition:**  Reacquire bandit after separation to assess next move, continue increasing HCA with small check turns, maintain 8-10 units AOA as speed increases.

**Errors:**

* Telegraphing intentions by rolling/pulling too early.
* Insufficient pull for maximum HCA.
* Failure to reacquire the bandit.
* Not maintaining unload.
* Terrain collision.
* Breaking back into the bandit after separation.

![Figure D-19. Separation](AAM-5_OBFM_page_34.jpeg)

#### Short Range Radar Employment

* **Priority:**  Fly good BFM first, then use HOTAS.
* **Radar Lock:** Essential for optimal weapon employment, but not mandatory.
* **Auto Acquisition Modes:** Used for short-range, visual acquisition and lock-on.

##### Auto Guns Mode

* Space-stabilized search (searches selected volume regardless of aircraft maneuver).
* **Advantages:** Large search volume, slewable, can be used for clearing beyond the fight.
* **Disadvantages:** MPRF waveform prevents locks inside 3000 ft, requires referencing radar scope for altitude coverage.

##### Heading-Stabilized Modes

* **Modes:**  Long Range Boresight, Boresight, Super Search, Vertical Scan.
* **Characteristics:**  Search area moves with aircraft maneuver.
* **Waveform:** Short pulse MPRF for locks as close as 500 ft.

**Mode Selection Considerations:**

* **Boresight:** Most discriminating (4° search around boreline), requires pure pursuit for lock-on.
* **Vertical Scan:**  Searches along lift vector, requires precise lift vector placement, can be challenging to use effectively.
* **Super Search:** Large, heading-stabilized search volume (slewable), requires target stability in search volume, has a blind zone.

##### General Recommendations:

* Select auto guns initially to search beyond the fight while maneuvering.
* After lock-on, select MRM from SRM/guns to force HPRF upgrade for potential AIM-7 shots.
