### Introduction

In air-to-air combat, employing BFM becomes necessary when forced into a defensive position. The goal is to survive until you can gain an offensive advantage or separate safely.  BFM combines various maneuvers, adaptable based on:

* Bandit's energy, turn capability, weapons, and pursuit curves.
* Aspect angle, angle off, and range.

This continuous process of forcing, predicting, assessing, and reacting aims to either achieve separation or maneuver offensively for a kill.

### BFM Mechanics and Definitions

BFM uses aircraft handling skills to address range, closure, aspect, and angle-off challenges. It involves blending roll, turn, and acceleration maneuvers.

#### Roll

* Positions lift vector to determine the plane of motion (POM).
* Helps maintain visual contact with the bandit.
* **Lift Vector Placement:** Critical for successful DBFM. Visualize it as a vertical plane extending from the canopy top, perpendicular to the wings.

**Key Points:**

* A max-rate break turn with the lift vector directly on the bandit maximizes angle generation and range reduction, denying the bandit turning room.
* Pilots tend to misalign the lift vector during DBFM due to their viewing angle. Visualizing it running between the F-15E's tails can help with proper alignment.

#### Turn

Fundamental BFM maneuver, used to evade attacks and deny weapons employment.

* **Break Turn:** Maximum performance turn.
* **Hard Turn:** Energy-sustaining turn.

#### Acceleration

Essential for energy management, especially when maneuvering demands deplete energy reserves.

* **Optimum Turn ("Opt Turn"):** Flown at 18-22 units AOA to preserve or gain energy.
* **Extension:** Quickest way to regain energy, flown at 8-10 units AOA.

**Acceleration Considerations:**

* Maintain situational awareness (attitude, altitude, airspeed).
* Avoid burying the nose during acceleration and losing energy during recovery.
* Recognize the trade-off between energy and nose position.
* Avoid prolonged acceleration, as it can give the bandit an angular advantage.
* Best acceleration occurs at minimum drag (8-10 AOA) with maximum afterburner between 300-450 KCAS.

### BFM and Aircraft Feel

Successful energy management requires understanding the aircraft's limits and developing a "feel" for its performance and energy state, especially while visually tracking the bandit. AoA control is crucial.

**Figure D-1:** Highlights key AOA values for maximizing F-15E performance. Generally, strive for 8/18/28 or 10/20/30 AOA, avoiding values in between.

![Figure D-1. BFM AOA Guide](AAM-6_DBFM_page_9.jpeg)

### Geometry

Understanding geometric relationships between your aircraft and the attacker is crucial for effective DBFM.

#### Positional Geometry (Figure D-2)

Describes the spatial relationship using:

* **Range:** Distance between aircraft.
* **Aspect Angle:**  Attacker's position relative to the target's tail, measured from the tail (0° = tail, 180° = head).
* **Angle Off (HCA):** Difference in headings between attacker and defender.

![Figure D-2. Range, Aspect, and Angle Off](AAM-6_DBFM_page_10.jpeg)

#### Attack Geometry (Figure D-3)

Three pursuit courses based on bandit's nose position and lift vector:

* **Lead Pursuit:** Bandit's nose points ahead of defender.
* **Lag Pursuit:** Bandit's nose points behind defender.
* **Pure Pursuit:** Bandit's nose points directly at defender.

These geometries are three-dimensional:

* **In-plane:** Pursuit course determined by bandit's nose position relative to defender's plane of motion.
* **Out-of-plane:** Pursuit course determined by where the lift vector will position the bandit's nose upon re-entering the defender's plane of motion.

![Figure D-3. Pursuit Curves](AAM-6_DBFM_page_11.jpeg)

#### Weapon Employment Zone (WEZ)

* Area in front of the attacker, bounded by weapon min/max ranges, where successful weapon employment is possible.
* Determined by attacker's ordnance, affected by airspeed, altitude, and turn capability.
* Defender can influence WEZ by controlling aspect, angle-off, and range.

#### Turning Room/Turn Circle

* **Turning Room:** Separation between aircraft, usable for acceleration/deceleration or turning into the turn circle to reduce aspect/angle off.
* **Turn Circle:** Mental projection of the defender's turn over time, influenced by G and airspeed.

**Entering the Turn Circle (Defender's Perspective):**

* Occurs when the attacker stops moving forward and starts moving aft on the canopy (aspect stabilizes or decreases).
* Prevents defender from turning hard enough to move the attacker forward of their 3/9 line.

#### Vertical Turning (Figure D-4)

* Gravity affects turn rate/radius.
* Lift vector above horizon: Reduced turn rate, increased turn radius.
* Constant G loop results in an "egg" shaped flight path due to varying radial G (Gr) during the maneuver.

![Figure D-4. Vertical Turning](AAM-6_DBFM_page_13.jpeg)

#### Downhill vs. Uphill Turns (Figure D-5)

* Downhill turn: Increased turn rate, decreased turn radius (lift vector below horizon).
* Uphill turn: Decreased turn rate, increased turn radius (lift vector above horizon).

![Figure D-5. Comparison of Downhill and Uphill Turns](AAM-6_DBFM_page_14.jpeg)

#### Vertical vs. Oblique Turning (Figure D-6)

Pure vertical turns prevent trailing, lower-energy adversaries from countering the energy differential with oblique or horizontal turns.

![Figure D-6. Vertical vs Oblique Turning](AAM-6_DBFM_page_15.jpeg)

#### Control Zone (Figure D-7)

* Position along the defender's turn circle where the attacker can maintain pressure.
* Allows attacker to transition into a WEZ with an energy advantage or defender error.

**Control Zone Limits:**

* **Inner Limit:**  Provides reaction time for attacker, gunshots, or maintaining minimum range/separation.
* **Outer Limit:**  Allows pressure without giving the defender opportunities to regain energy or change the fight.

**Figure D-7:** Shows a generic control zone for F-15E vs. F-15E BFM.  Adjust based on adversary's capabilities.

![Figure D-7. The Control Zone](AAM-6_DBFM_page_16.jpeg)

### Defensive BFM

#### Objective

Survive the attack by:

* Denying/defeating the attacker's weapons.
* Generating range, closure, aspect, or angle-off problems.
* Maintaining visual contact with the attacker (tally).
* Managing energy effectively.

#### Defensive Strategy

Focus on a simple, effective strategy that denies the attacker valid shot parameters and forces a reaction.  Assume a worst-case scenario (bandit at 5-7 o'clock with overtake). Adapt as needed based on situational awareness.

#### Initial Moves

* **Extension:**  May be suitable at long range with low closure, but risks misjudging range and being within weapon parameters.
* **Merge High Aspect/Engage Offensively:** Possible if bandit is acquired at 2 nm or greater with sufficient energy.
* **Break Turn (Inside 2 nm):** Prioritize denying weapon employment. Perform unloaded roll to bring lift vector on/slightly below bandit, initiate turn based on bandit's range/aspect/ordnance/overtake, employ countermeasures (chaff/flares).

**Break Turn Considerations:**

* Closer attackers require harder turns (up to maximum G).
* Allow airspeed to bleed towards corner velocity initially.
* Adjust power/speedbrake to optimize turn performance.
* Monitor bandit position for effectiveness (forward movement indicates success).

**Break Turn vs. Hard Turn (Figure D-8):**

* Break turn: Generates greater angle-off and overshoot, especially with higher initial aspect/angle-off.

![Figure D-8. Break Turn Effectiveness vs Angle Off/Aspect/G-Loading](AAM-6_DBFM_page_19.jpeg)

#### Visual References for Defensive BFM

* Develop a sense of range using visual cues (beacon visibility, intake/tank recognition).
* Determine pursuit geometry based on bandit's nose position and aircraft features (lead: bottom of aircraft visible; lag: top of aircraft visible; pure: nose-on).

#### Aspect Angle References (Figures D-9 & D-10)

* Bandit forward of wing tip (inside 9000 ft): Approaching WEZ.
* Bandit over aileron: In control zone (≈30° aspect).
* Top of vertical tails also corresponds to ≈30° aspect.

![Figure D-9. Aspect - FCP](AAM-6_DBFM_page_21.jpeg)
![Figure D-10. Aspect - RCP](AAM-6_DBFM_page_21.jpeg)

#### Angle-Off References (Figure D-11)

* Bandit outside canopy bow: Generally safe from all-aspect ordnance.
* Fuselage length = wingspan width = 45° angle-off.
* Other references based on fuselage/wingspan ratios.

![Figure D-11. Angle Off or Heading Crossing Angle References](AAM-6_DBFM_page_22.jpeg)

#### Analyzing the Fight

* **Initial Turn Effectiveness:** Bandit moving forward indicates success, otherwise increase turn rate.
* **Bandit Nose Position:**
    * Lead/pure pursuit: Expect high aspect pass, prepare for front quarter gun attack, jink and attempt separation.
    * Out-of-plane: Bandit is building turning room. Unload and roll to reorient on bandit if high on energy, otherwise opt turn or extend to regain energy.
* **Extension:**  Monitor bandit for re-entry into plane of motion. Turn hard with countermeasures if threatened.
* **Overshoot:**
    * **Flight Path Overshoot:** Bandit crosses your path but stays within your longitudinal axis. Continue turning to reacquire and prevent low aspect shot.
    * **Longitudinal Axis Overshoot:** Bandit crosses to the other side of your aircraft. Consider range, angle off, and closure.

**Reversal Considerations:**

* Generally suitable for overshoots with close range, high aspect/angle-off, and high closure.
* Confirm overshoot before reversing.
* **Rules of Thumb:**
    * Aspect: 80-120°.
    * Range: <3000 ft.
    * Fast LOS rate.
    * Low nose rate.

#### Bandit at 9000 Feet

* Bandit is near your turn circle, less time to generate angles.
* Immediate break turn with maximum G is essential.
* Power/speedbrake adjustments as needed for optimal turn performance.
* **Lead Pursuit:**
    * Bandit aft of wing line: May be arcing for closure, consider extending or turning hard.
    * Bandit forward of wing line or with sufficient overtake:  Turn hard with lift vector on bandit, prepare to deny snapshot.
* **Lag Pursuit:**
    * Inferior turning bandit: Continue turning.
    * Superior turning bandit: Opt turn or extend, but be cautious of bandit driving to 6 o'clock. Alternatively, maintain moderate G turn (4-5 Gs) to force repositions and bleed energy.

#### Bandit at 6000 Feet

* Immediate action is critical (missile range).
* **Nose-on:** Break turn, maximum G, power/speedbrake adjustments, countermeasures.
* **Lead Pursuit:**
    * Analyze aspect and overtake to determine bandit's intentions.
    * Turn hard with countermeasures if bandit has sufficient overtake.
    * If bandit is arcing, consider extending or maintaining hard turn.
* **Lag Pursuit:**
    * Inferior turning bandit: Continue hard turn.
    * Superior turning bandit:  Opt turn or extend, monitor for re-entry and counter accordingly.

#### Bandit with Insufficient Turn Rate (Figure D-12)

* If the bandit is forced into lag due to inferior turn performance, maintain hard turn and exploit your advantage.

![Figure D-12. Superior Turn Performance](AAM-6_DBFM_page_28.jpeg)

#### Bandit with Superior Turn Rate (Figure D-13)

* Bandit may attempt a "lag corner" maneuver (driving to blind cone, slowing down, and shooting).
* **Counter:**  Turn hard to maintain tally, then unload to sustained G and force repositions, prepare for gun defense.

![Figure D-13. Lag Corner](AAM-6_DBFM_page_29.jpeg)

#### Bandit at 3000 Feet

* Extremely critical situation (immediate threat).
* **Nose-on:** Break turn to force lag or overshoot.
* **Lead Pursuit:**  Assume gunshot possibility, initiate gun defense (jink) based on aspect and overtake.

#### Gun Defense (Jink)

* Three-part maneuver: Unload, roll out of plane, break turn into new plane.
* **Timing:** Lead the bandit's gun range by 1-2 seconds.

**Common Errors:**

* Losing tally: Predict bandit movement during jink.
* Late initiation: Start before bandit is in range.
* Rolling at high AOA: Unload first for faster roll rate.
* Insufficient out-of-plane movement: Go 90° for low aspect attacks.
* Not holding jink long enough: Watch for bandit moving toward canopy rails.
* Jinking up with insufficient energy: Be prepared for follow-on jinks.
* Jinking in the same plane as the bandit: Makes range easier for the attacker.

**Post-Jink Maneuvering:**

* If jink is successful, pull up into the bandit's new position to increase closure.
* If energy is low, consider extending while the bandit is nose-off.

#### Transition From the Defensive

##### Overshoots (Figure D-14)

* Occurs when the attacker cannot solve angular problems and repositions.

![Figure D-14. Forcing the Overshoot](AAM-6_DBFM_page_33.jpeg)

* **Two Types:**
    * **Flight Path Overshoot:**  Bandit crosses your path but stays within your longitudinal axis. Continue turning to reacquire and prevent a shot.
    * **Longitudinal Axis Overshoot:**  Bandit crosses to the other side of your aircraft.  Assess range, angle off, and closure for reversal potential.

##### Reversals (Figure D-15)

* Not all overshoots are suitable for reversals.
* **Favorable Conditions:**  Close range, high aspect/angle-off, high closure, bandit approaching defender's 3/9 line.

![Figure D-15. Reversal](AAM-6_DBFM_page_35.jpeg)

**Reversal Options:**

* **Continue Turning:** If unsure about reversal or overshoot occurs at long range.
* **Set Wings and Pull:** If bandit is level and moving towards your 3/9 line.
* **High-G Rolling Reversal:**  If sufficient airspeed and confident in overshoot, maintain G and use rudder/aileron to roll. Risks high energy loss if misjudged.

#### Intercockpit Directive Defensive Commentary

These calls, from WSO to pilot, assume WSO has visual contact while the pilot does not.

* **"Hard Left/Right":**  Defensive turn to prevent bandit entry into vulnerable cone.  Intensity depends on situation.
* **"Roll Left/Right":**  Refine lift vector placement (10-30° roll).
* **"Tighten Down":**  Increase turn intensity (G or AOA).
* **"Ease Off/Op Turn":**  Decrease turn intensity (G and AOA), maintain max power.
* **"Break Left/Right/Up":**  Immediate, maximum performance turn for missile threat (maximum G, power/speedbrake as needed, countermeasures).
* **"Reverse Left/Right":**  Loaded roll reversal during bandit overshoot, maintain G, blend aileron/rudder.
* **"Set Your Wings":**  Unload for quick aileron roll to check bandit position after overshoot.
* **"Pull":**  Vertical pull to slow/stop horizontal movement and gain nose-tail separation, maximum AOA until bandit motion slows/reverses.
* **"Jink":**  Guns defense maneuver, 2-8 seconds, multi-plane, maintain tally.
* **"Extend":**  Gain energy or separate, max power, 8-10 units AOA.
* **"Check (Degrees) Left/Right":**  Hard check turn to maintain tally during extension.
* **"Pitchback Left/Right":**  Nose-high course reversal from high airspeed, 6 G pull with max power.
* **"Sliceback Left/Right":**  Nose-low course reversal from low/medium airspeed, roll lift vector below horizon and pull, maintain 400 KCAS or greater.
* **"Pitch Left/Right to Slice":**  Efficient course reversal from high airspeed, simultaneous 6.5 G pitch-up and power reduction, transition to sliceback near corner velocity.
* **"Floor":**  Ground or designated training floor (typically 5000 ft AGL).

#### Floor Considerations

* **"Floor Transition":** Begin when dive angle equals 10% of altitude above the floor (e.g., 30° nose-low at 8000 ft with a 5000 ft floor).
* **"Floor Save":** Level wings and pull up abruptly if floor is not recognized in time.
* **"Floor Fight":**  Continue BFM but adapt to limited vertical maneuvering.

#### Common DBFM Errors

* Losing tally.
* Not maneuvering relative to the bandit.
* Poor lift vector control (not on/below bandit).
* Allowing excessive vertical turning room.
* Extending too long, allowing bandit nose-on access.
* Poor power control (too fast or too slow).
* Ineffective reversals (timing or aggressiveness).
* Not using countermeasures when appropriate.
* Poorly timed or in-plane gun jinks.

### Conclusion

Defensive BFM is a last resort in the F-15E. If forced into a defensive situation, remember these principles:

1. Use BFM only when necessary and only as much as required.
2. Continuously maneuver to deny shot opportunities.
3. Exploit bandit mistakes to gain offensive advantage, maintain position for a shot, or separate if a shot is not possible.
