### Mission Planning

Premission planning is crucial for mission success. There is no single best solution to any tactical situation. A prudent flight leader considers all options to develop a game plan that:

* Accomplishes mission objectives
* Is executable by the least experienced flight member

### Mission Planning Sources

#### Air Tasking Order (ATO)

The ATO, or "frag," is written by the theater air component commander and directs the mission and required assets. It lists:

* Call signs
* Ordnance
* Targets
* TOTs
* Mission commander
* Package elements
* Tanker information
* Support assets
* Special Instructions (SPINs)
* Notes

#### Airspace Control Order (ACO)/Airspace Control Plan (ACP)

The ACO implements airspace control procedures. Aircrew must be familiar with:

* Minimum Risk Routing (MRR)
* Missile Engagement Zones (MEZs)
* Fighter Engagement Zones (FEZs)
* Kill Zones
* Kill Boxes
* Preset CAP points
* AWACS orbits
* Tanker tracks

#### Intelligence

Intelligence provides data on:

* Air/ground/electronic order of battle
* Enemy defenses
* Probable points of encountering defenses
* Number and type of systems
* Avionics capability and tactics (observed and estimated)

#### Weather

The weather shop provides estimates of weather conditions that may limit or enhance options. Consider:

* Cloud layers
* Visibility
* Contrail level
* Solar azimuth and elevation
* Moon illumination
* Weather restrictions at divert fields
* Impact on support assets

### Mission Planning Considerations

#### Weather

* **Cloud layers:** May force altitude changes for visual lookout and threat reactions.
* **Contrails:**  Highlight you visually but can limit radar search.
* **Visibility:**  May require tighter visual formations or detached mutual support.
* **Sun angle:** Can determine offset direction and attack geometry.
* **TDA/IR visibility:**  Influences attack profile or direction.
* **Moon illumination and elevation:** Important considerations for night missions.
* **Winds:** Factor in wind at altitude and weapon time of fall for target attacks and fuel planning.
* **Diverts:**  Weather affects fuel requirements and divert field availability.

#### Terrain

* **Ingress/Egress altitudes:** Consider mission objective, threat capability, crew workload, and radar detection.
* **Terrain masking:** Offers concealment but can limit radar detection and weapons capabilities.
* **Low altitude:** May affect GCI capability.
* **MSL vs. AGL:**  Consider for threat assessment, ejection altitudes, RWR, and weapons effects.
* **Radar blind zones and ambush CAP locations:** Factor these into your radar game plan.

### Available Assets

The ATO outlines assets dedicated or available for your package. Consider:

* **Tankers:**  Numbers, track location, marshal plan, divert fuel, refueling priority, boom time, and availability.
* **GCI/AWACS:**
    * Capabilities and limitations.
    * Communications: Frequencies, chattermark procedures, and control levels.
    * Radio/radar blind zones: Impact on CAP and search.
    * Prebrief controller with commit/engagement criteria, flow plan, and degraded operations options. 

* **Other assets:** (A/A players, SEAD, strikers) â€“ Ensure the plan incorporates combined force employment.

### Combat Air Patrol (CAP)

When entering the CAP area:

* Complete fence check, trigger check, and alpha checks.
* Compare the environment with the weather brief.
* Note F-15E visibility (looking up/down) and sun position: Affects intercept flow direction.
* Check winds: Impacts GMTR setting (above ~50 knots for GMTR chaff).
* Perform SYS ALT RESET:  (before EGI installation) as the radar uses system altitude for display.
* Consider airspace restrictions, AOR, and how the environment affects intercepts. 
* Gather alibis from the formation: Assess system functionality and potential intercept plan alterations due to limiting factors.

**Types of CAPs**

Refer to AFTTP 3-1, Volume 17, Chapter 15 for details on different CAP types and employment considerations.

**CAP Principles**

* Proper orientation and placement.
* Command, control, and communication when off-threat axis.
* Adequate time and look angle for search.
* Intercept room preservation until committed.

**CAP Objectives**

* Develop a mental 3D picture of the presentation.
* Make sound commit decisions.
* Commit from CAP in the desired formation.

**CAP Briefing**

* Length, location, altitude, and formation in the CAP.
* Marshalling point before commit.
* Fluid two-ship formation until commit.
* Hot leg (radars down track) slower than cold leg to maximize radar look time.
* CAP location:  Ensure opportunity to commit early and engage bandits in the DEZ.
* Talker priority: 
    * Hot leg: Lead - GCI - Wingman.
    * Cold leg: GCI - Lead - Wingman.

**Factors Affecting CAP Considerations**

* **Altitude:** Weather, fuel, anticipated threats, terrain, dissimilar formations, and radar footprints.
* **Speed:**  Fuel, GCI availability, and threat proximity (ROT: Mid 20s use 350 CAS, .9 M if in the 30s).
* **Turns:**  CAP geometry, winds at altitude, and flight lead preference.

### Radar Setup

Tailor your radar setup to the anticipated tactical and environmental situation.

#### PRE

* **Interleaved PRF:** Generally best for threat detection at all aspects and long-range.
* **Other waveforms:** Consider when specific threat parameters are known (e.g., high fast fliers, EW environment).
* **MPRF:** 
    * Easier formation breakout.
    * Assists with maneuvering contacts (especially at/near the beam).
    * Reduces IPRF range ambiguities.
    * Sacrifices long-range detection due to decreased power output. 
    * MPRF gain decreases below 5000' and may increase false returns ("birds") at low altitude.

#### Scope Range

Set to detect the threat, analyze geometry/threat maneuvers, and allow for commit (establish DEZ) while considering factor bandit range.

#### Azimuth Selection

Limit azimuth selection when:

* A single threat axis exists (lane assignment).
* GCI/AWACS coverage supplements your radar coverage.

#### Frame Store

* **Frame Store 1:**  Adequate if one crew member can dedicate sufficient time to radar interpretation.
* **Frame Store 2:**  Consider if crew duties limit radar interpretation time.
* Using a higher frame store option than normal can be more confusing than helpful.

#### GMTR

* **Settings:** LO, MED, HI, and CHF.
* Each setting uses specific velocity filters for target detection and radar blind zones in medium PRF.
* **CHF:**  Special logic for search, TWS, and manual acquisition (not track) in chaff environments.
* **Optimal setting:** Determine based on altitude, winds, threat axis, and chaff encounter probability. 
* Lower GMTR settings: May be necessary for detecting slow-speed targets.

#### Acquisition Symbol Placement

* Prebrief a range to ensure all flight members use the same reference for altitude coverage.
* ROT: Use meld range for acq symbol placement.

#### Altitude Search Selection

* Sanitize altitude and divide elevation AOR for complete picture building.
* **Scope range:** Set as desired (40-80 nm) with acquisition symbols at the briefed meld range.
* **High/Low search:** Divide elevation coverage to ensure complete picture.
* **Overlap:** At least 2000 feet at meld range to avoid coverage holes.

**Example:**  (Refer to Table D-1)

* AOR: 20,000-40,000 feet MSL
* Acq symbols: 20 nm
* 4-bar: 12,000 feet coverage, 14" scan movement
* 6-bar: 16,000 feet coverage, 21" scan movement

* AOR: Same
* Acq symbols: 25 nm
* 6-bar: More effective for covering the AOR

**Key Takeaway:** Increasing bar scan from 4 to 6:

* 33% increase in altitude coverage.
* 50% increase in search time.

| Bar Scan | Range (NM) | Altitude Coverage | Time (sec) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | 4 |  |  |
| 4 | 4 |  |  |
| 6 | 6 |  |  |
| 6 | 6 |  |  |

**Notes:**

* Assumes scope range > 40 nm, RWS interleaved, and one complete bar scan.
* Altitude coverage ROT: bar scan and 2 x range = alt coverage.

**Table D-1**

#### Elevation Coverage â€“ Bar Selection

* **Time per frame:**  Determined by sweep rate, bars per frame, and azimuth width. 
* **Considerations for limiting altitude coverage:**
    * Contrail level
    * GCI/AWACS coverage
    * Workload
    * Limited altitude AOR
    * Radar footprint
    * Radar desensitization

### Air Force Mission Support System (AFMSS) and Mission Planning Support System (MPSS)

AFMSS (and its replacement, MPSS) are useful for mission planning and data preparation. Key functions:

* Flight planning
* Fuel data
* Mission routes
* Bull's-eye points
* Airspace restrictions/definitions
* Offset points
* DTM loading (TSD/radar/INS display data, communication plans, IFF phasing, munitions loads, jettison programs).

### Communication Plan

* **Frequency list:** Refer to ATO and SPINs.
* **Load frequencies:** Prioritize those most likely to be used, but carry a complete plan. 
* **Authentication:** ATO specifies current, backup, and emergency procedures.
* **KY-58:** Confirm fills (through 781) and remote control head setting (UFC operation).
* **Have Quick:** Same considerations as KY-58. 
* **Multiple periods:** Flight time/duration may require multiple periods for authenticators, frequency plans, etc.
* **Have Quick loading:**  Consider two periods (one per radio).
* **Multiple WODs:** (Have Quick IT) can be loaded via AFMSS for both radios. 
* **HQ I/II:** Be prepared for situations where either is directed.

### DTM List and Sequence Points

* **Display essential data only:**  Avoid clutter.
* **Sequence/List points:**
    * Define routes.
    * Reference contingencies (alternate tankers, divert fields).
    * Outline AORs, lanes, troop concentrations, dump targets, etc.
* **Mission symbols:** (sequence, offset, aim, and target points) to mark points or areas of interest.
* **Land/Sector CAPs:**  Enter points to define AOR edges/corners for display on radar/TSD, enabling quick bandit location assessment.
* **Display flexibility:** Display one route on TSD while steering to another (displayed on radar).
* **DTM organization:** Organize data points and restore to squadron standard after the mission.

### IFF Phasing

* Program IFF modes/codes for the mission.
* Slave AAI to phased IFF.
* Phasing: Occurs on central computer time (Data 1), so ensure phasing and aircraft clock are synchronized (local or Zulu). 
* EGI:  Defaults CC clock to Zulu time. 
* AAI slaved to IFF: IFF mode changes (manual/phased) force matching AAI codes (Modes 1 and 3).
* AAI Modes 1/2/38 default to the correct code.

### Aircrew and HUD Data

* Programmable display, scrolling, and master mode selections.
* Specifiable HUD titling data and default radar settings for MRM and SRM.

### Ordnance

* Specify ordnance loads for combat/training PACS (A/A and A/G).
* Specify combat jettison options.
* Configuration data generates TOLD information. 

### Crew Coordination

Effective crew coordination is vital for F-15E mission success. Brief these tactical mission elements:

* **Radar:**
    * Who controls it during each intercept phase?
    * Consider proficiency, day/night, and altitude.
    * Pilots and WSOs should not make assumptions about radar control responsibility.

* **Targeting pod:**
    * Who operates it? (Generally, the crew member not operating the radar).
    * Situations may require one person to operate both sensors.

* **RWR:**
    * Primary responsibility? (Both crew members should strive to include it in their cross-check).

* **CMD:**
    * Who dispenses it, and when?
    * Dispense quantity per actuation.

**Future Considerations:** As the F-15E evolves (e.g., fighter data link with OFP Suite 4), crew coordination will become even more critical. Both pilots and WSOs should be experts on all aircraft systems.

### Visual Lookout

* Coordinate visual lookout pre-mission.
* Refer to AFTTP 3-8, Volume XVII for responsibilities and visual search techniques.
* "Cage" clock positions and elevation descriptions before A/A engagements using ground and air references for consistency. 
* **Deconfliction:**  
    * WSO watches pilot's head and searches a different area.
    * Be descriptive about search area (e.g., "?M HIGH, OUTSIDE....").

### Intercockpit Communication

* Minimize communication, limiting it to mission-essential information.
* Use AFTTP 3-1 brevity words and squadron-specific "standard" communication.
* Avoid self-induced communication jamming.
* Pre-brief specific information needs (timing and format) for effective communication.

### Contingency Planning

#### Weather

* Develop bad weather plans for all mission aspects:
    * Marshal deconfliction
    * Attack deconfliction
    * Weapons delivery
    * Threat assessment
    * Tanker plan
* ATO may specify minimum weather requirements.

#### Package Fallout/Late

* **Minimum assets:** Determine what's necessary for mission accomplishment (A/A players, tankers, SEAD package).
* **Limited tanker plan:**  Establish procedures.
* **Mission slip:**  Determine acceptable delay and communication procedures to inform all players.
* **Asset origins:** Consider that assets may originate from various bases or AORs. 

### Intercept Geometry/Tactics

* **Objective:** Position the flight to kill enemy groups while avoiding being killed.
* **Goal:** Leverage geometry for positional advantage while maximizing radar work time.
* **Maximize F-15E WEZ:** Minimize the bandit's WEZ.

**Game Plan Factors:**

* Mission
* Threat
* Weapons load
* Number of threat groups
* Risk level (specified by HHQ)

**Risk Level Guidelines:**

* **High:** Accept potential losses from a merge.
* **Medium:**  Merge undesirable, but acceptable.
* **Low:**  Losses or a merge unacceptable.

#### Launch and Leave

* Take shots and execute an out/abort maneuver outside decision/abort range. 
* Defeat the bandit's WEZ and avoid a merge.
* Usually requires medium altitude for shots (reduced shot ranges make it near impossible from low altitude).

#### Launch and Decide

* **Initial phase:**  Heat up the intercept.
* **WEZ management:** Outside bandit's maximum shot range (typically outside meld range).
* **Target, shoot, and crank:**  Continue WEZ management and F-pole.
* **"Worming" (bonsai):** Continuous flow toward the target/bandits.
* **"Skate" (launch and leave):** An option if A-pole/F-pole range permits.
* **Offset:** Slows the intercept, providing time to: 
    * Build the picture (especially when bandits are maneuvering).
    * Run the ID matrix.
    * Start WEZ management.
* **Wingman offset:** Usually outside the flight, allowing visual search through lead and simplifying visual lookout/position keeping.
* **30Â° radar scribe:** Effective for establishing offset while maintaining radar contact.
* **Group targeting:** Drives intercept options.

#### Factor Bandit Range (FBR) and Shot Depth (SD)

* **FBR:** Minimum range between threat groups allowing F-pole on the closest group while maintaining FLO on all groups beyond that range.
    * All groups within FBR must be targeted.
    * Groups outside FBR can be engaged subsequently or avoided.
    * Do not include groups outside FBR in initial targeting to maximize firepower.
    * Influenced by: Threat weapons, F-15E weapons, closure, and proficiency. 

* **SD:** How far missile shots will be taken into groups.
    * Varies by tactic (LD or LL).
    * See AFTTP 3-1, Volume 17, Chapter 15 for rules of thumb on FBR, SD, and threat WEZs.

#### Intercept Options

##### CATA

* Fastest intercept type.
* Allows maximum range shot.
* **Disadvantages:**
    * Reduced time for picture building, target/sort, EID, and shooting.
    * Solves the intercept problem for the enemy.

##### Single-Side Offset

* Element offsets on one side of the bandit formation (Figure D-1).
* Detect the target using superior F-15E radar and offset the formation.
* Wingman must maneuver to the deployed position immediately.
* Between initial offset and pure pursuit range: Assess, sort, assign targets, and employ ordnance. 
* **Critical wingman position:** Sort plan, visual lookout, and radar gimbal protection.

[Figure D-1: Single-Side Offset Intercept]

**Advantages**

* Good visual mutual support.
* Geometry responsive to target maneuvers.
* Similar radar pictures for sorting.
* Good single radar option.
* Slows intercept pace.

**Disadvantages**

* Single-axis merge.
* Targets may get tally on both F-15Es.
* Wingman may be forced to trail at pure pursuit range.
* Time and fuel-consuming to chase bandits who check away.

##### Bracket

* Envelop the target formation from both sides after a front-quarter merge (Figure D-2).
* Exemplifies multi-axis entry.

[Figure D-2: Bracket Intercept]

**Advantages**

* Multi-axis attack complicates bandit visual acquisition.
* Developing bracket provides turning room for at least one F-15E upon any bandit reaction.
* At least one F-15E has sufficient profile for VID.
* Good visual lookout until bracket development.

**Disadvantages**

* Poor visual lookout within the bracket.
* Bandit maneuvers may force short-range switches.
* Potential communication degradation in jamming environments.
* Wide splits: Likely sortable by target radars.

##### Inside-Out

* Contingency for late threat detection when bracketed with insufficient intercept room (Figure D-3).
* Requires splitting and inside-out intercept.

[Figure D-3: Inside-Out Intercept]

**Option:** Lean into one side of the bandit formation to take other bandits "out of the fight."

**Advantages**

* Maintains visual mutual support until pure pursuit range.
* Responsive to bandit maneuvers.

**Disadvantages**

* Flight already bracketed.
* Predictable flight path until pure pursuit range.
* Degraded mutual support beyond pure pursuit range.
* Potential belly exposure to the opposite bandit at merge.

##### Hook-ID

* Contingency for single-radar plan, forced VID, or radar/missile problems in one aircraft (Figure D-4).
* Hotter single-side offset with the disadvantaged wingman positioned for ordnance employment.
* Wingman in favorable offensive position at merge upon lead's hostile contact declaration or shot timeout.

[Figure D-4: Hook-ID Intercept]

**Advantages**

* High kill potential:  Wingman has good belly entry if the bandit reacts to lead at merge.
* Good coverage of leader's 6 o'clock.
* Achieves visual identification.
* Responsive to target maneuvering.

**Disadvantages**

* Wingman must clear own 6 o'clock.
* Leader will likely lose visual on wingman.
* First merging aircraft may lack offensive potential for some time.

### Intercept Basics

Air-to-air game plans are not "standard," but should consider these variables:

* Mission (OCA, DCA)
* Flight makeup (two-ship, four-ship)
* Risk level (high, medium, low)
* Tactic (launch and leave, launch and decide)
* Radar vs. group/contact (multitargeting with AIM-120s)
* Ordnance (AIM-120s/-7s/-9s)
* Missile management (desired missile/contact ratio)
* Threat (long-burn radar, short-burn radar, limited-aspect radar, heat)

**Range Ladder:** Account for these variables and build back from the predicted blue air FLO range.

**Memorize Missile Shot Range Rules of Thumb:** Altitude affects different missile shot ranges.

**Continuously Ask During A/A Planning, Briefing, Execution, and Debrief:**

1. **Formation:**  Lead â€“ executing briefed flow, intercept, and tactics? Wingman â€“ in position or correcting?
2. **Radar:** Lead/Wingman â€“ in assigned AOR or targeting IAW plan/directives?
3. **Communication:**  Lead/Wingman â€“ using brevity, following the communication plan, actively listening?

### Communication and Picture Building

Clear, concise, and accurate communication is crucial for building situational awareness and engagement. 

#### Key Factors

* **Brevity:** Communicate effectively and efficiently.
* **Accuracy:**  Ensure information is correct and unambiguous.
* **Listening:** Actively listen to build a comprehensive picture.
* **Pacing:** Avoid communication overlap and establish a clear flow.

#### Communication Flow

* **Back to the fight:** GCI primary talker, followed by lead, then number two.
* **Radars down track:**  Fighters as primary talkers, with GCI filling in.

#### B/E vs. BRA

* **B/E communication:** Generally preferred for clarity among fighters and blue air assets (F-15Cs, AWACS, GCI).
* **BRA format:** Use only when appropriate (e.g., "POP-UP GROUP," F-15Ks together).
* **Preface calls:**  "BULL'S-EYE" or "BRA" unless briefed otherwise.
* **AFTTP 3-1:**  Follow guidelines for proper communication.
* **Attachment 1 to AFTTP 3-1, Volume 1 (Dec 99):**  Reference for brevity words and terminology.

#### Calling the Picture and Labels

##### Fundamentals

* **Group criteria:**  AW AFTTP 3-1 (currently 3 nm, use 15,000' altitude as an addition).
* **Nonstandard group definition:**  May be briefed (e.g., 5 nm, 10,000').
* **Group:**  A radar hit that may contain one or more contacts.
* **Preface calls:** "BULL'S-EYE" or "BRA" to reduce ambiguity.
* **Full call sign:** Use with every radio transmission.
* **Core information:** Number of groups, bull's-eye location, altitude, and tracking direction.
* **Single group:** Call "GROUP," not "single group."
* **Anchor group location:**  
    * Start with the group closest to the fighters.
    * Followed by the next closest, and so on. 
    * If equidistant, anchor the group closest to the bull's-eye first.
* **Groups within 5 nm of B/E:** Label "over bull."
* **More than three groups:** 
    * Call the number of groups.
    * Anchor only the group closest to the fighters.
    * Example:  "EAGLE 1, 4 GROUPS, CLOSEST GROUP BULL'S-EYE 270/25, HITS 15,000, FLANK WEST."
* **Fill-in information:**  Number of contacts, formation, eyeballs, ID criteria met ("SPADES"). 
* **Labeling:**
    * Aids fighter targeting and lead's intercept geometry/targeting decisions.
    * Don't "force the picture" â€“ if a label doesn't apply, call out each group's location relative to the B/E.
* **Two-group labels:**
    * **Azimuth relationship:**  Northern, southern, etc.
    * **Range relationship:**  "LEAD GROUP" and "TRAIL GROUP."
    * **Inner-group relationships (sorting):** "SIDE-SIDE" and "NEAR-FAR." 
* **"ECHELON" fill-in:**
    * Wider than long:  "... TWO GROUPS, AZIMUTH SPLIT 10, ECHELON NORTHWEST, SOUTHERN B/E...." 
    * Longer than wide: "... 2 GROUPS, RANGE SPLIT 10, ECHELON SOUTHWEST, LEAD GROUP B/E...." 
* **Three or more group labels:** Wall, ladder, champagne, vic (Figures D-5 and D-6).
* **Split call:** Refers to the distance between the outer edges.
* **Three-group wall/ladder:** Middle group is called the "middle group."
* **Four-group ladder:**  Groups after the lead are labeled "second, third, fourth," etc. 
* **Four-group wall:**
    * Outside groups: Cardinal directions (e.g., "northern" and "southern").
    * Inside groups: "Southern middle" and "northern middle."
* **Champagne:** Attack of three groups (two in front, one behind) where the leading groups attempt to bracket with the trailing group flying up the middle.
    * Azimuth split called first, then range split.

* **Vic:** Three groups/contacts with a single closest (in range) and an element/two groups trailing. 
    * Range split called first, then azimuth split.
    * AFTTP 3-1, Volume 17: Currently directs calling champagne and vic labels the same way (azimuth first, then range).

* **Vic group labeling:**
    * Closest group: "Lead group."
    * Trailing groups: "TRAILERS" (e.g., "northern trailer," "southern trailer").

* **Champagne group labeling:**
    * Closest two groups: "Lead groups."
    * Group closest to fighters: Anchored off B/E.
    * Third group: "TRAILER."

* **More than three contacts (undeterminable number):** "HEAVY" (AFTTP 3-1, Volume 1).
* **Specific contact count (if possible):**  Provide the exact number. 

* **Maneuvering groups:** 
    * Call the maneuver (e.g., "EAGLE 1, LEAD GROUP MANEUVER.").
    * Once steady: "FLANKING/BEAMING/DRAGGING."

* **Unprocessed group (two consecutive sweeps):**  "FADED" and "ESTIMATE" to anchor fade location.
* **Label changes:**
    * Call "NEW PICTURE."
    * Do not change labels inside a prebriefed range (typically meld range).
    * If no prebriefed range, use the briefed targeting/meld range as the cutoff.
* **Previously unreported group:**  
    * "NEW PICTURE" may be needed.
    * Outside meld/target range:
       * Called a new group and anchored off B/E.
       * Call a new picture if possible. 
       * Example: "EAGLE 1, NEW PICTURE, THREE-GROUP LADDER, RANGE SPLIT 10, LEAD GROUP B/E...."

    * Inside meld/targeting range:
       * Called a "pop-up group," use BRA.
       * Targeted by a threatened fighter unless already assigned a higher threat.

[Figures D-7 and D-8: Picture building communication examples]

### Intercept Flow

Flow is based on:

* **Environmentals:** Sun position, cloud deck, etc. 
* **Package flow:** Avoid leading threats toward the strike package.
* **Prebriefed tactics:** CATA, SSO, bracket.
* **Desired intercept geometry.**

#### Phases

##### Search

* Assign responsibilities during briefing.
* Consider:  Threat, experience level, AOR, radar setup (Figure D-9).
* Leads typically search their expected threat AOR. 
* **Initial search:** 120Â° sweep (except in turns) until all factor groups are within a narrower sweep.
* **120Â° sweep (25 nm acq symbol placement):** 50 nm of azimuth coverage. 

[Figure D-9: Overlapping Search Blocks]

* **Search extremes first:** Radar footprint is smaller at extremes, making it easier for bandits to go undetected (Figure D-10).

[Figure D-10: Radar Footprints]

* **Key principles:**
    * **Discipline:** 
        * Sanitize AOR.
        * Use briefed acq symbol placement.
        * Move acq symbols to the expected bandit azimuth and range.
        * Optimize HPRF at the predicted/called target range.

    * **Patience:**  
        * Allow the radar to complete a full sweep before resetting coverage.
        * Monitor bar scan on radar scope or use timing to confirm full sweeps.

* **Radar scope interpretation:**
    * Twice as wide as it is long (e.g., at 20 nm, 120Â° sweep = 40 nm wide).
    * 30Â° block width = 1/2 the range.
    * Acq symbols: ~6Â° wide (at 30 nm, they are 3 nm wide). 
    * Altitude:  Given in RWS with acq symbols over a contact (+/- 5000' accuracy).

* **TWS:** 
    * Avoid using within meld +5 nm to meld (unless targeting with a radar-versus-group plan).
    * Never use for search:  Search block too small.

##### Sample

* Occurs multiple times during the search phase.
* Build SA on detected groups: Bandit/friendly, hot/cold, high/low, fast/slow.
* **STT:** Provides the most information on a specific target.
* **Additional systems for group data:** EWWS, TWS, acq symbol/altitude coffin, AAI, EID, NCTR, Highlight mode, apparent drift.
* **Hot targets:** Require a hotter intercept profile.
* **Offset intercept:**  Hot targets require more maneuvering to achieve offset.
* **Displayed shot ranges:** 
    * Indication of when to take the final lock.
    * How to modify other ranges (target, meld, sort, LNLT).

* **STT/HDTWS:** May be needed for NCTR depending on ID criteria.
* **Extended STT:**  Reduces SA on the rest of the group and other groups.

##### AAT/EID/PID

* **Electronic identification:** Critical in a BVR environment.
* **Early "HOSTILE" call:** Enforces a kill mindset early in the intercept.
* **Quick "FRIENDLY" call:**  Frees up cognitive resources.
* **EID:**
    * Possible without locking.
    * Use to ensure a "clear field of fire."
    * Avoid locking on friendly replies.

* **AAI/EID:**  Can be confusing.
* **Recommended technique:**
    * Set EID to ROE criteria.
    * Set AAI to locate flight members.
    * Check aft in RCP and inboard in FCP to identify bandits.
    * Avoid shooting diamonds (AAI or EID).

##### Identification Criteria and Communication Terms

* **BANDIT:** Positively identified enemy aircraft (identification-based term, not necessarily implying engagement authorization). 
* **HOSTILE:** Bandit cleared for engagement IAW theater ROEs.

**BVR ID criteria:** Mission/scenario dependent.

**Positive Enemy Indication Requirements:** May include:

* **Point of Origin (POO):**  Group operating beyond a political boundary, FEBA, FLOT, or enemy safe area. AWACS may use the term "OUTLAW."
* **NCTR:**  Unambiguous return indicated with "PRINT" followed by a clear call or code word. 
* **Mode X:**  Return indicated with "ECHO" (AFTTP 3-1). 
* **AWACS/GCI Declaration:**  May declare a group hostile based on POO, IFF, situational awareness (typically for aircraft without onboard interrogation equipment like F-16s).

**Lack of Friendly Indication Requirements:**

* Complete IFF/SIF code check.
* STT/PDT:  Complete processing, not just initiation.
* **"PAINTS":**  (AFTTP 3-1 "friendly IFF interrogation return") â€“ Group IS squawking required friendly modes/codes.
* **"SPADES":**  (AFTTP 3-1 "lack of required friendly IFF reply") â€“ Group IS NOT squawking required modes (1, 2, 3C, or 4 depending on SPINs).

##### Commit

* **Criteria:**  ROE dependent, typically including factors like range from CAP, AOR, aspect, airspeed.
* **DEZ:**  Fighters commit to engage targets within a desired engagement zone, which may be defined by the AOR or flight lead. 
* **Wingman:** Can recommend, but lead has commit authority.
* **Briefed criteria:**  Guide, not a contract for commit.

##### Aborted Commit

Reasons to abort: 

* Long-range bandits.
* Bandits outside DEZ.
* Overwhelming bandit numbers.
* Lack of PID.
* EA.

**Aborted commit procedures:** Include in the plan and ensure understanding by all players. 

**Commit Mechanics:**

* Climb to maximize WEZ and ensure FLO.
* Accelerate above Mach (if able).
* Jettison fuel tanks (consider ROE, squadron standards, and fuel considerations). 

##### Sanitize

Resanitize your AOR 5 nm prior to the meld, remembering to search extremes first. 

##### Target

* Begins at commit during picture building.
* Generally target groups and sort within groups.
* **Factors influencing targeting:** 
    * Fighter/bandit numbers and ordnance.
    * Planned fighter tactic.

* **Targeting plans:**
    * **Radar versus group:** Assign a radar to each factor group and multitarget using TWS and AIM-120s.
    * **Radar versus contact:** Assign multiple radars per group, sort within the group, and engage each contact with AIM-7s/-120s.
* **Well-briefed plan:** Targeting should be obvious and require minimal directive communication.

#### Owning and Sharing Groups

Understanding the concepts of owning and sharing groups is crucial for effective targeting.

* **Owning a group:**  You are the primary targeter responsible for killing/maintaining SA on all contacts in that group. This happens when:
    * You are targeting IAW the briefed plan.
    * You are directively targeted to a group.
* **Responsibilities of owning a group:**
    * Maintain responsibility until a positive handoff is made (to another flight member, AWACS, or GCI).
    * If your group maneuvers and meets your RTS criteria, you are still responsible. 
* **Typical group owners:** Flight leads and element leads.
* **Sharing a group:** You are a secondary targeter responsible for assisting the primary. This occurs when a meld is called on a group and you are designated to meld.

**Example:**

* **Scenario:** Fighters step with radar vs. group plan, multitargeting using TWS and AIM-120s. 
* **Initial picture:** Single group, four contacts; fighters only have three AIM-120s each (insufficient to multitarget the entire group). 
* **Lead's call:**  "EAGLE 2, MELD BULL 360-50-21,000, FOUR CONTACTS, AZIMUTH."
* **Result:** Changes from radar vs. group (each fighter owning) to radar vs. contact (both sharing). 
* **Note:** Fighters must still multitarget into the heavy group to cover all contacts.

#### Primary vs. Secondary Targeter Responsibilities

* **Primary:**
    * Locking the group at the briefed range.
    * ID if required.
    * Multitargeting or calling the meld if sharing is required.
    * Communicating sort responsibilities if required.
    * Eyeball count.
    * Maintaining STT/PDT on their side or the highest threat.
    * Communicating bandit maneuvers.

* **Secondary:** 
    * Sanitizing and melding around the primary targeter's group.
    * Targeting splitters and pop-ups.
    * Sharing the group when called in.
    * Targeting the group when directed (e.g., shots trashed, heavy group). 

**Important Note:** These are prebriefed responsibilities; lead always has final authority for directive targeting. 

##### Meld

* **Meld range:** Depends on desired weapons employment range. Refer to AFTTP 3-1, Volume 17, Chapter 15.
* **Purpose:**  To establish visual contact with the target group and:
    * Determine sort responsibility.
    * Initiate targeting.
* **Meld call procedure:**
    * Acq symbols placed at briefed lock/sort range. 
    * Adjust altitude coverage to locate responsibility.
* **Altitude coverage:**
    * Initially center on called/last known group altitude.
    * As proficiency increases, bias coverage 5,000' below/above the target, toward your wingman's AOR.
* **Meld range considerations:** Weapons load, altitude, and threat.
* **Timely meld:**  Allows for EID completion and sort for FLO/desired launch range.
* **Critical information (sorting):** Group altitude (e.g., "EAGLE 2, MELD, 25,000"). 
* **Additional information (if applicable):**  Group position relative to nose and meld range (e.g., "EAGLE 2, MELD, 25,000, BRA 360-25"). 
* **Inner group picture:** Communicate ASAP after the meld call (e.g., "EAGLE 2, MELD 25,000, SIDE-SIDE.").
* **Post-meld communication and actions:**
    * **"CLEAN":**  Called if unable to acquire the picture after two full sweeps.
    * **TWS/Multitarget:**  Fighter with the picture selects TWS and multitargets if able.
    * **Guidance for "CLEAN" fighter:** Fighter with the picture directs the "CLEAN" fighter to the sort location. 
    * **"De-meld":**  Lead's directive call to return to search (in respective AORs) if both fighters are "CLEAN."
        * Bring acq symbols 3-5 nm in front of the last known contact to ensure overlap.

##### Lock No Later Than (LNLT)/Sort

* **Lock range:** Ensures FLO against the adversary. 
* **Valid sort:**  All players lock/sort at the predetermined LNLT range.
* **Invalid sort:**  Primary targeter (usually flight/element lead) locks to ensure FLO. 
* **TWS after initial shot:**  Select if multiple contacts are known/expected (when owning the group).
* **Sorting objective:** Engage all targets within a group to maximize pre-merge kills.
* **Meld call:**  Must precede a sort; otherwise, assume the primary targeter is multitargeting and sanitize for pop-ups/splitters.
* **Sort driver:** Radar-apparent geometry, not the actual bandit formation. 

#### Possible Radar-Apparent Formations for Sorting

* **Side-Side (azimuth):**  One side of acq symbols fits between returns.
* **Near-Far\* (range):**  Distinct range breakout (generally â‰¥ 2 nm).
* **High-Low (altitude):**  May appear as a single return at two separate altitudes. 

\* Recall:  "Near-far" is used for inner-group formation (sorting), while "lead-trail" is used when labeling groups in range (picture building, targeting).

#### Primary Sort Plan

* Match your formation.
* **Range sort:**  Leads take closest, wingmen take farthest. 
* **Azimuth sort:** Take the bandit matching your formation position.
* **Trail formation (NAV FLIR trail) and side-side sort:**  Brief how to handle (e.g., inside-out).
* **Multitargeting (more targets than missiles) contingency:**  Brief a handling plan. Consider assigning cardinal directions (lead sorts north, wingman sorts south).

#### Sort Communication

* **Successful sort:** Call your sort with the appropriate label (e.g., "EAGLE 2 SORTED FAR").
* **Unsure of valid sort:** Call "LOCKED" with the B/E and altitude.
* **Rule of 2s (when unsure):**  If unsure of a valid sort after locking, use the rule of 2s (altitude 2,000', range 2 nm, or heading 20Â°) to confirm.
    * Example call: "EAGLE 2, LOCKED, B/E 230, 20, 20,000."

#### Possible Responses to "LOCKED" call 

* **"EAGLE 1, SORTED NEAR, B/E 235, 25, 15,000":**  Confirms a valid sort (Eagle 2 is sorted far).
* **"EAGLE 1, LOCKED SAME, HEADING 180":** Eagle 1's contact is within the rule of 2s for altitude and range. 
    * Check bandit heading for >20Â° difference: 
        * Good sort (>"20Â°"):  "EAGLE 2, HEADING 210, GOOD SORT."
        * Bad sort (â‰¤"20Â°"): "EAGLE 2 BAD SORT, BAD SORT."

* **Bad sort procedure:**  The first to recognize it breaks lock and attempts to achieve a valid sort (unless missiles are already airborne).
* **Missiles airborne:**  Call "BAD SORT, FOX 3 THERE," and flight lead determines who breaks lock and sanitizes to re-establish the sort.

**Remember:**

* "Sorted" â‰  "Locked"
* Maintain situational awareness and engage your assigned target when in position.
* Sort on the shortest-range scope possible (maximizes apparent radar breakout).
* **Near-far sort:** Bring acq symbols in from the front (lead group) and back (trailer). 
* **Azimuth sort:**  Approach from outside your designated target. 
* **Leading the lock:**  Allows the contact to "fly" into your mini-raster (radar displays history). 
* **Spearing:** Using the inside acq symbol tip to designate your sort responsibility (Figure D-11).
* **Lock range:** Generally dependent on bandit altitude (WEZ); a good rule of thumb for NLT lock range is 20 nm. 

[Figure D-11: Moving in and Spearing]

##### Shot

Shot considerations are driven by:

* Mission
* Risk level
* Weapons load
* Altitude
* Threat

**Weapons Employment:** Plan and brief primary shooters (not always the element leads).

#### Missile Management

Always critical. Consider:

* **"Shoot-look-shoot":**  Shoot, assess, shoot again if necessary. 
* **"Shoot-shoot-look":** Shoot two, then assess. 
* **Desired DMC:**  30-50 (can be increased by centering the dot/lofting on a CATA intercept).
* **Goal:** Single-shot kill (monitor initial shots and take follow-up shots if needed).

#### Post-Shot Maneuvers

* **Crank:**  Execute a hard turn (4-5 Gs) at least 50-60Â° cold on the scope immediately after firing.
* **Descend and slow down:** Maintain tactical airspeed.
* **Monitor:**  Bandit maneuvers while maintaining the crank to avoid gimbal.
* **HUD aspect stick vs. radar B-scope heading stick:** Do not confuse them. During an aggressive crank, the target may appear to be maneuvering on the radar heading stick. Verify using the displayed heading or HUD aspect stick.
* **Crank direction:**  Support your lead/wingman if possible. 
* **Crank objective:** 
    * Decrease the bandit's WEZ.
    * Maximize your F-pole. 
* **TWS shots:**  Do not provide an expanded F-pole, so maintain TWS volume and limit pre-MPRF active G forces to 4. 

##### Crank Priorities

1.  **Away from spikes:** Prioritize avoiding the bandit's WEZ. 
2.  **Away from known factor threats:** Isolate threats to one side if possible. 
3.  **With briefed flow/mutual support:** Follow the briefed package flow and maintain mutual support with your flight lead.
4.  **Against your bandit and away from his nose.** 
5.  **Toward green airspace:**  Leverage GCI or SA.

**Important:** Maintain situational awareness of the picture/threats when switching from RWS to STT. Communicate your actions clearly.

##### Decision Range

The range at which you must decide:

* Whether to press the attack or disengage.
* Winning, losing, or neutral (refer to AFTTP 3-1, Volume 17, Chapter 15).

##### Abort Range

The last opportunity to disengage and avoid a merge (refer to AFTTP 3-1, Volume 17, Chapter 15).

##### Shot Depth

How far into a threat display missiles will be employed (refer to AFTTP 3-1, Volume 17, Chapter 15).

##### Split

* **Guidance:** Provided to the wingman.
* **Decision point:** When target maneuvers pull the wingman out of formation, decide whether to split or maintain formation and pass to GCI.
* **Split criteria:**  Typically briefed as target aspect at a specific range (applies to pop-up groups inside meld range).
* **Rule of thumb:** Split if bogey/bandit aspect is greater than the range inside FBR.
* **Briefing:**  Specify if split is automatic or requires a request.
* **Communication:**  Essential for maintaining SA.

**Split Communication:**

* **"Floating":**  Target at 45Â°, requiring a turn to maintain radar SA. 
* **"Split":**  Request to leave formation and prosecute at visual limits. 
* **"Crossing":**  Crossing lead's 6 o'clock to maintain radar SA/STT.

##### Drop/Monitor

* **Objective:**  
    * Avoid target-induced formation breakdown and loss of mutual support/SA.
    * Prevent extended STT focus on a bandit outside the WEZ, allowing an untargeted bandit to close within WEZ and achieve a firing solution.
* **Monitor/RTS criteria:**  When outside a WEZ and: 
    * Target beam aspect is greater than 15 nm.
    * Target drag aspect is greater than 10 nm.
* **"DROP":** Indicates responsibility handover to another agency/flight (GCI, F-15C, other A/A assets). 

**Remember:**  Meeting RTS criteria does not automatically mean "DROP." Maintain SA on your target/sort responsibility and try to achieve a tally-ho or targeting pod lock before returning to search. Select MPRF and 60Â° sweep to increase chances of maintaining radar contact. 

### All-Aspect Missile Defense (AAMD)

**Key:** Continuous awareness of:

* Spike status
* Shot status
* Range 

**Important (especially when firing AIM-7s):** Knowing whether you were spiked before or after your shot.

#### Offensive Engagement Considerations

* **Decision/Abort ranges:**  Use ranges based on the threat (refer to AFTTP 3-1 for recommendations) to ensure:
    * You can defeat front-quarter shots kinematically. 
    * You will be outside the rear-quarter WEZ after the maneuver.

* **Outside abort range:**  Choose between aborting or notching. 
* **Inside abort range:**  Forced to notch.

#### Abort vs. Notch Decision

* **Winning:** Naked and supporting a missile. 
* **Losing:**  Spiked within threat shot range and have not fired. 
* **Abort:**  If in a losing situation outside abort range, or lacking good SA inside meld before abort range.

#### Abort Execution

* **Sliceback:**  135Â° turn in AB to place the bandit/bogey on your tail in minimal time while maximizing aircraft performance. 

#### Losing Situation Inside Abort Range

* Hard descending turn to the notch. 
* Chaff deployment.
* Attempt a visual acquisition.
* Prepare for IRMD.

#### General Guidelines

* Abort as a flight/element if possible. 
* Notch as a singleton. 
* Flight lead has final authority on aborts (directive call). 
* Wingman's abort call is descriptive. 

#### Visual Arena

While most game plans aim to remain BVR, some situations may necessitate a merge:

* **Responsibility handover:** Effectively transfer radar/visual responsibility between cockpits.
* **Denying/Acquiring tally:**  Provides a significant advantage.
* **"Blind" and "Stripped" calls:** Communicate these situations immediately if they occur: 
    * **"BLIND":**  Lost visual contact. 
    * **"STRIPPED":**  Outside briefed formation and unable to rejoin tactically.

### Infrared Missile Defense (IRMD)

#### Pre-Merge

* Maximize speed before reaching 10 nm.
* IRMD effectiveness: Varies by threat missile.

#### General Technique (Against Less Than 4th Gen Heaters)

* **10 nm:**  Begin cooling down (out of AB if bandit is hot >16 AA).
* **8 nm:** Stand up throttles if able. 
* **5 nm:** Return power to idle and flare if spiked. 

#### AAMD Technique

* **8 nm:**  Out of AB.
* **5 nm:** Stand up throttles.
* **3 nm:** Power to idle, flares, and break into the bandit to deny IR shots.

**Use:** Timing and tally to gauge distances for maneuvers. 

**Countermeasures:** Crew coordinate employment to avoid simultaneous deployment and waste. 

#### Merge

* Potential for ACM engaged/supporting roles. 
* Use proper communication (refer to 334 FS/DOW ACM communication handout). 
* **Multiple bandits:** 
    * Clear your flight path. 
    * Maintain visual contact with all players to prevent collisions. 
* **Flow to additional groups:** Supporting fighter usually monitors and directs flow after engagement. 

#### Egress/Separation

* **Priority:**  Rapid separation (direction secondary). 
* **Ideal separation:** Toward friendly airspace. 
* **General rule:**  "Same way, same day" to regroup.
* **Post-separation:** Change altitude and return to friendly airspace as a flight.
* **Rendezvous plan:**  Necessary in case of flight separation.
* **Egress considerations:**  Fuel and ordnance status. 
* **Have a short-range radar game plan.**

### Short-Range Radar

Employ short-range radar mechanics to clear your flight path when:

* Exiting a merge. 
* Turning onto an unsanitized heading. 

#### Technique

* **Visualize:** Create a "bubble" of cleared airspace around your formation. 
* **Near to far search:**
    * Use AUTO GUNS biased towards your AOR (each sweep takes approximately 6 seconds).
    * After one sweep in your AOR, bias towards the other AOR for one sweep. 
    * Visually search the AOR opposite the AUTO GUNS search. 
* **After clearing both AORs (approximately 12 seconds):**
    * Return to 20 nm scope, MPRF, and 120Â° sweep.
    * Place acquisition symbols at half scope (10 nm).
    * Set prebriefed altitude coverage for at least one full frame. 
* **Return to long-range search.** 

**Remember:**  You have coverage out to 30 nm on a 20 nm scope due to the APG-70's range-limited cue capability.

#### Short-Range Commits

* **Outside meld range:** Handle IAW briefed long-range plan (groups prefaced with core DBE information).
* **Inside meld range:**
    * **"POP-UP" with BRA:**  Communicate and expect directives from the flight lead (target assignment or sanitization).
    * **Multiple contacts:**  Call a meld and sort.
* **Inside FBR:**
    * Bandit is likely in a WEZ.
    * Revert to ACM communication and roles.
    * **"ENGAGED" call:** Include BRA (radar acquisition) or clock position (visual acquisition).
    * Prioritize ID and engagement. 
    * Monitor spike status and react accordingly.

[Figure D-12: Short-range commit communication]

#### Defensive Response

* **Situational awareness:**  Maintain continuous spike status awareness. 
* **Correlated threat (on radar):**  React as you would for AAMD.
* **Uncorrelated spike:**
    * **Far:**  Turn to put a radar on the spike and use short-range radar to locate, ID, and engage. 
    * **Medium/Near:** Treat more cautiously, as the bandit may be in a WEZ:
        * Spiked fighter: Turns towards the notch. 
        * Naked fighter:  Turns towards the spike bearing, using short-range radar and visual lookout to locate and engage.

### Contingencies

Consider these contingencies:

* **Single contact/unsortable group:** Prebrief who locks and shoots (consider lead preference and experience levels).
* **SKOSH/WINCHESTER:** Automatic RTB or continue for radar SA?
* **Fighter fallout:** 
    * Who assumes primary talker, targeter, and shooter roles?
    * How does the formation change?
* **GADGET BENT:**
    * Assign "tactical" lead to the aircraft with the functional radar. 
    * Execute an offset intercept to the visual arena. 
* **AAI/EID BENT:** The aircraft with the functioning AAI has authority on bandit calls. 
* **RWR/CMD/ICS BENT:**
    * Allow for personal crew decisions. 
    * One technique: One good RWR in the element; assume the same spike status.
* **Electronic Attack (EA):**
    * **Deception techniques ("MUSIC"):** Counter with MPRF. 
    * **Noise techniques ("STROBES"):**  Counter with HPRF.
    * **Additional countermeasures:**  Switching radar channels, offsetting formation.
* **Return to search:** Establish threat-dependent criteria (generally, 10 nm for draggers and 15 nm for beam contacts). 
* **High Fast Flyer (HFF):**
    * Define in the brief. 
    * Engagement may require: 
        * Aggressive intercept geometry
        * Climb for near co-altitude 
        * Hot aspect (>16 AA)
    * Consider missile selection (AIM-7 vs. AIM-120).
