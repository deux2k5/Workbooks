### Introduction

Understanding High Aspect BFM (HABFM) is crucial for Strike Eagle pilots. It's a realistic way to start air-to-air engagements, as intercepts often lead to high-aspect merges. HABFM may also be necessary for short-range engagements against undetected bandits.

Pilots must grasp the concepts of offensive and defensive BFM to turn high-aspect passes into advantageous positions. HABFM teaches:

* Maneuvering for offensive advantage from high aspect setups.
* Recognizing when and how to separate if the situation deteriorates.

### BFM Mechanics and Definitions

HABFM objectives mirror offensive BFM:

* Maneuver to a WEZ and kill the bandit.
* Achieve an offensive position.
* Separate before becoming defensive.

**Energy Management:**

* Essential for gaining and maintaining an advantage in any BFM situation (as in OBFM and DBFM).
* Includes both kinetic energy (from throttle) and potential energy (from altitude).

**Vertical Turning Room:**

* New concept in HABFM: using altitude to gain an initial offensive advantage.
* Starting above corner velocity may be necessary, especially for low-to-high lead turns (due to energy loss during uphill turns).
* Monitor airspeed, G-availability, and maneuvering capability to exploit turning room effectively.

### Initial Moves in High Aspect BFM

Three basic options when facing a bandit head-on:

1. **Missile Launch (FOX-1/2/3) followed by:**
    * **Blow-through:** Extend and disengage.
    * **Separation:**  Regain energy and re-engage.
    * **Turn:**  Engage in a turning fight.

#### Missile Launch

* If ROE, ordnance, and weapons systems permit, this is a likely first move.
* Use auto-acquisition modes for radar lock-on (if not already established) and ensure weapon parameters are met.
* AIM-9M and AIM-120 can be employed visually without a lock (remember deconfliction, especially when launching without a lock).
* Launching first creates a 2v1 advantage, even if the missile is defeated (bandit's energy will be depleted).
* If the bandit launches first, react defensively before continuing the engagement (but consider launching your own missile as you react).

#### Bug Out

* Possible during the early stages if fuel, weapons, aircraft issues, or other bandits warrant it.
* High heading crossing angles allow for acceleration, blow-through, and separation maneuvers.
* **Deny tally (if possible):** Maintain near pure pursuit until merging.
* **Bandit turns towards you:** Minimize turning room by maintaining a pure pursuit course and consider a high-angle gun attack (if turning room allows). Be aware of the bandit's potential gun employment.

#### Turning Fight

* The third option, and often the least desirable.
* Engage in a lead turn and choose an entry for a one/two-circle fight if conditions are favorable or mission dictates bandit elimination.

### Turning Room

* **Definition:**  Displacement from the adversary's flight path plane, allowing you to execute a turn and roll out at their six o'clock.
* **Ideal scenario:** Bandit doesn't see you, giving you ample time to establish turning room. Unlikely in a tactical situation unless the bandit has no SA.
* **Amount needed:** For a well-timed 180Â° lead turn to a bandit's six o'clock, you need one turn diameter (yours, not the bandit's).
* **Factors affecting turn diameter:** TAS, G, and use of vertical maneuvers (working with or against gravity).
* **Tactical considerations:** MCM 3-1 addresses choosing turning room above, below, or in the horizontal plane.
* **Key point:** Turning room available to you is also available to the bandit. Be prepared for the bandit to initiate a lead turn on you.

### Lead Turn

* **Definition:** Attempt to decrease angle-off before passing the opponent's 3/9 line (turning before 3/9 passage).
* **Planes:**  Horizontal, vertical, or a combination.
* **Goal:** Gain offensive advantage for entering a weapons envelope.
* **Sequence of maneuvers:** Often required to achieve a favorable position.
* **Bandit denial:** Can deny your lead turn by turning into you (attempting their own lead turn). Result is a close aboard high-aspect pass.

[Figure D-1: Lead Turn]

#### Lead Turn Execution

* **Ideal outcome:** Roll out in the bandit's six o'clock area within the control zone (Figure D-1).
* **Factors for success:** Offset (horizontal and vertical), timing, G-loading, bandit's actions.

#### Establishing Offset

* Achieve during terminal intercept stages or visually after a long-range tally-ho.
* Aim for both horizontal and vertical turning room: Provides flexibility against an unaware attacker.
* **Rule of thumb:** 4,000 to 7,000 feet of turning room.
* **Visual reference:** Place the high-aspect bandit outside the canopy bow (high or low, as in Figure D-2).
* **Bandit lead turn indication:** If they turn towards you after you establish offset, they are lead turning you.  Reposition to your nose and expect a high-aspect merge.

[Figure D-2: Visual Reference for Turning Room]

#### Choosing Vertical Turning Room

* **Above:** 
    * **Advantages:** Radial G, smaller turn radius, easier energy maintenance, easier entry judgment.
    * **Disadvantages:** Exposes you to bandit lookup radar shots, potential IR missile clutter.

* **Below:**
    * **Advantages:**  Radar ground clutter, potential for sky/cloud highlighting, easier bandit visibility. 
    * **Disadvantages:**  Requires higher airspeed (larger turn radius), higher G on conversion (potential for over-G), harder entry judgment.

* **Factors influencing choice:** Tactical considerations, environment (clouds, sun).

#### Lead Turn Timing

* **Cue:** Increased bandit line-of-sight rate.
* **Initial offset:** Bandit appears stationary on canopy.
* **Closing range:** Bandit begins to move on canopy. 
* **Initiate turn:** When bandit movement increases "dramatically."

#### Lead Turn Procedure

1.  Unload.
2.  Rotate lift vector in front of the bandit.
3.  Initiate a pull (typically 5-6 Gs, but adjust based on altitude relative to the bandit).
4.  **Goal:** Enter the bandit's control zone (approximately 3,000 feet in their stern).

#### Monitoring Bandit Position During the Lead Turn

* **Initial:** Bandit near canopy bow.
* **Turn progression:** Bandit tracks towards HUD for the first third to half of the turn, then gradually drifts up and away.
* **Stationary bandit:**  Collision course (adjust with a lag maneuver). 
* **Bandit tracks through HUD:**  Lead turn started too early ("no respect" lead turn, adjust with a lag maneuver).

[Figure D-3: Early Lead Turn]

#### Lead Turn Summary

* Most efficient way to gain advantage from a neutral pass.
* Avoid lead turning if:
    * You want to bug out. 
    * You want to separate for energy and re-engage. 
    * In these cases, maintain pure pursuit for maximum HCA and effective separation. 

#### Common Lead Turn Errors

* Late LOS rate recognition/not using available turning room: Allows the bandit to lead turn you, failing to reduce angle-off at the merge. 
* Turning before LOS becomes apparent:  May put you in front of the bandit. Adjust your lift vector towards their six and pull to pass close aboard (behind the bandit) if turning room permits.
* Not lead turning after the first merge:  Don't accept consecutive high-aspect passes; continue lead turning until the bandit is neutralized.
* Not prepared for the merge: Lean forward to maintain visual contact. 
* Excessive pure pursuit for auto-acquisition lock-on:  Loss of turning room. 
* Forgetting separation option:  Leads to becoming anchored or defensive. 

### High Aspect BFM: Initial Moves

Assuming bugging out is not the plan, three options remain at the pass:

1. **Extend and Comeback:**
    * **Procedure:** Monitor bandit's turn, maintain tally, and separate in full AB.
    * **Advantages:**  Good for low energy, limited SA, or facing a superior turning aircraft. Provides an opportunity for a front-aspect AIM-9 or AIM-120 shot.
    * **Disadvantages:**  Risk of losing visual during extension and high-G turn back. Surrenders initial positional advantage and dangerous against all-aspect threats (bandit may use your extension time to reposition for a shot).

2. **Hard Turn at the Pass (Horizontal or Oblique):**
    * **Advantages:** Easier tally maintenance, potential turn rate advantage at corner velocity.  Quickest path to weapon parameters if the bandit separates. 
    * **Disadvantages:**  Anchors the fight and requires high energy. Can lead to energy depletion and a defensive position if done incorrectly. 

3. **Vertical Fight:**
    * **Procedure:**  Employ pure vertical maneuvers (no oblique), engage AB early, and use max rate over the top. 
    * **Advantages:**  Potential for disorienting the bandit, exploits potential energy and radial G.
    * **Disadvantages:** Difficult to maintain visual contact, may give the bandit a clear sky background for their shot.

#### One-Circle vs. Two-Circle Fights

* The maneuver choice dictates whether it becomes a one-circle or two-circle fight (determined by the aircraft that turns last).
* Avoid reversing your turn after a significant lead turn:  You'll sacrifice the angles you've built, giving the bandit an advantage at the merge.

#### Two-Circle Fight

* **Definition:**  Crossing each other's extended six flight path (second merge typically occurs after approximately 270Â° of turn).

[Figure D-4: Two-Circle Fight]

* **Advantages:**
    * Opportunities for intimidation (max turn and point) or energy (sustained turn and observe) fights.
    * Leverages superior turn rate/radius.
    * Allows for all-aspect weaponry and HOTAS.
    * Better separation options if needed.
    * Potential for AIM-9, AIM-7, or AIM-120 shots.

* **Disadvantages:** Longer path to kill, gives the bandit similar options, and maintaining tally can be more difficult against smaller aircraft.

#### When to Employ a Two-Circle Fight

* **Bandit has superior turning performance.**
* **Your airspeed is much higher:**  Leads to a larger turn radius compared to the bandit.
* **Energy conservation:**  Tends to be a faster fight than a one-circle fight, allowing for greater separation potential.
* **Weapons employment:** More room for all-aspect weapons and better HOTAS capability.
* **Unknown bandit:** Provides time to assess the bandit's aircraft and skills; offers better separation opportunities. 

#### One-Circle Fight

* **Definition:** Both aircraft turn in the same direction.

[Figure D-5: One-Circle Fight]

* **Advantages:**
    * Shortest path for a quick kill.
    * Jams the bandit's long-range ordnance.
    * Effective against turn-deficient bandits.

* **Disadvantages:**
    * Surrenders turning room.
    * Energy-intensive. 
    * Jams your own all-aspect missiles. 

* **Best employed:**  When you have a significant turn advantage.

#### When to Employ a One-Circle Fight

* **Your turn radius is smaller:** (e.g., F-15E vs. F-4).
* **Bandit's airspeed is much higher:**  Impacts their turn rate/radius.
* **Your aircraft has superior slow-speed handling:**  One-circle fights can lead to scissors maneuvers.
* **Tactical surprise:**  Can catch the bandit off guard and force an error.

**Note:** One-circle fights are primarily nose position fights, not sustained energy fights. Commit decisively and gain nose position quickly with aggressive lead turns.

### High Aspect BFM Considerations

#### High Speed/Poor Turning Bandit

* **Objective:** Intimidate the bandit and force energy-depleting defensive turns.
* **Engage in a one-circle fight.**
* **Get inside the bandit's turn circle quickly (without sacrificing all your airspeed).**
    * Use the vertical if possible (you may have exclusive access).
    * Maintain ~450 knots at the merge and slow to corner speed for a turn rate advantage. 
* **Lag as needed:** But maintain pressure to keep the bandit turning and losing energy. 
* **Expect extensions:** The bandit will attempt to keep the fight fast and may take the fight vertical to try and force an error.
* **Employ weapons:** Take FOX 1s, 2s, and 3s to force defensive maneuvers.
* **Maintain control of the horizon.**
* **Below 350 knots at the top of the egg:**  Exploit horizontal turning room as the bandit cannot use the vertical above you.
* **Vertical lead turns:**  Take small bites, but avoid getting greedy.

#### Common Errors (High Speed/Poor Turning Bandit)

* Pulling too late to utilize available lead turn. 
* Failing to force the bandit below 420 knots to exploit your turn rate advantage. 
* Depleting all your energy and becoming trapped in the bandit's turn circle without a shot opportunity. 

#### Slow Speed/Good Turning Bandit

* **Bandit characteristics:**  Likely thrust-limited, but capable of generating maximum angles at low speeds. Will try to force a close-range fight. 
* **Your objective:**
    * Maintain sufficient energy for sustained turns.
    * Drive the bandit's energy down to gain a vertical advantage.

* **Game plan:** 
    * Force a two-circle fight.
    * Get the bandit to bleed energy early. 
    * Execute a level or low-to-high lead turning pass. 
* **Vertical fight:** 
    * Gain an energy/airspeed advantage.
    * Use an optimal pull to climb above the bandit. 
    * Expect the bandit to try and force an energy error. 
* **2nd and 3rd merge:**  
    * If the bandit lead turns low, counter by going high.
    * If both go vertical, use AB and airspeed to establish exclusive vertical turning room. 
    * Employ 5-6 Gs (not 7-8) during pulls. 
* **Once above the bandit:**  Aim for the control position, using your lift vector to slowly work towards guns. 
* **Snapshot considerations:** Ensure over-the-top airspeed to prevent the bandit from arcing your oblique turn. 

#### Common Errors (Slow Speed/Good Turning Bandit)

* Failing to maintain pressure on the bandit.
* Letting a slow bandit intimidate you with nose position and allowing them to match your energy.
* Using max turns instead of sustained turns, depleting your energy and losing access to the vertical. 

#### Good Turn Rate and Radius Bandit

* **Challenging opponent.**
* **Objective:**  Leverage HOTAS and F-15E's all-aspect missile capabilities for a quick kill. 
* **Respect the bandit's capabilities:** May include advanced features like AA-11 off-boresight capability. 
* **Game plan:**
    * Force a two-circle fight to exploit your all-aspect missile advantage.
    * Use the fastest auto-acquisition mode available.
    * Consider no-lock AIM-120s (if safe/deconflicted) or boresight AIM-9s if radar lock is delayed.
    * Respect the bandit's nose and maneuver accordingly.
    * Employ chaff/flares as necessary.
    * Sustain/regain energy.
    * Aim to gain a lead turn advantage on subsequent merges.
    * Separate if you're not gaining or are losing an advantage.
* **Crucial:**  Knowledge of enemy aircraft and ordnance capabilities.

#### Common Errors (Good Turn Rate and Radius Bandit)

* Not flying your best 1v1 BFM and missing shot opportunities.
* Improper energy management. 
* Allowing the bandit to win the rate fight due to your errors. 

### Conclusion

Key takeaways:

* Once engaged, employ your best 1v1 BFM until the bandit is killed or separation is necessary.
* Train in all BFM elements (high/low speed, offensive/defensive) to develop a comprehensive skillset.
* Effective BFM skills ensure efficient and successful combat employment of your aircraft.
