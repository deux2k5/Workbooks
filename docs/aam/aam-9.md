### Introduction

ACM bridges basic intercepts and BFM, encompassing:

* Pre-merge mechanics
* Element roles/responsibilities
* Communication
* Weapons employment
* Post-merge maneuvering
* Situational awareness
* Threat response

This discussion focuses on two-ship 2v1 engagements.

### Fighter Roles and Responsibilities

AFTTP 3-1 defines roles as "engaged" and "support" fighters. Knowing your role is crucial for successful attack or threat defeat. Once established, each role has specific responsibilities, while all fighters are expected to fly effective BFM to minimize losses/delays in neutralizing the threat.

#### Engaged vs. "Engaged Fighter"

* **Engaged (AFTTP 3-1, Volume 1):** F-15E maneuvering to kill (applies across the BFM spectrum). Often applies to both F-15Es.
* **Engaged Fighter:** The aircraft actively working to kill/survive, while the Support Fighter focuses on deconfliction and smart BFM.

### Engaged and Support Roles

In a 2v1 engagement, one aircraft is the **Engaged Fighter**, while the other is the **Support Fighter**. Roles can switch multiple times during an engagement, requiring clear communication and maneuvering to hand off responsibilities.

#### Engaged Fighter Responsibilities

* **Best BFM to Kill/Survive:** Fly your best BFM regardless of offensive/defensive situation. Game plan remains the same as if fighting alone.
* **Clear Your Flight Path:** While the Support Fighter is primarily responsible for deconfliction, the Engaged Fighter must still clear their own path and strive for visual contact.
* **Allow Support Fighter to Engage:** If the Support Fighter becomes defensive or has a better offensive entry and calls "ENGAGED," the Engaged Fighter should relinquish the role if conditions allow.

#### Support Fighter Responsibilities

* **Maintain Deconfliction:**
    * **BVR:** Maintain visual on the Engaged Fighter and bandit.
    * **Visual Arena:** Maintain tally/visual or constant SA to prevent flight path conflicts.

* **Execute Smart BFM:**
    * **Engaged Fighter Offensive:** Maneuver for weapons separation and a missile shot.
    * **Engaged Fighter Defensive:** Maneuver for immediate weapons employment (missile or gun).

* **Secondary Responsibilities:**
    * Clear the area for additional threats.
    * Direct defensive responses/maneuvers for weapons deconfliction.
    * Maintain 360° situational awareness.
    * Monitor fuel and separation opportunities.

These roles allow for efficient two-aircraft threat engagement with minimal communication and clear responsibilities.

### Deconfliction

#### Support Fighter's Responsibility

The Support Fighter is **always** responsible for deconfliction until a proper role exchange occurs. The bandit's actions determine the Engaged Fighter and may necessitate a role swap.

* **Control Zone:**  High-risk area due to offensive BFM driving fighters into this limited space.
* **Support Fighter Actions:**
    * Ensure the Engaged Fighter is not a factor before entering the control zone.
    * Avoid hindering the Engaged Fighter's ability to engage the bandit. 
    * Employ all-aspect weapons against the bandit once shot deconfliction is achieved.

#### Role Establishment

##### Engaged

* **Default:** Flight lead until cleared to engage the wingman.
* **Fluid role exchange:** More effective elements respond to the bandit's maneuvers and readily swap roles.
* **"ENGAGED?" Call:** Initiates role establishment (hierarchy: most defensive, most offensive, then flight lead). Requires a response for confirmation.
* **Ideal Response:** "EAGLE 2" (indicates tally and acceptance of the support role). Some leads may prefer "EAGLE 2, TALLY."

##### Defensive

* **Definition:**  The aircraft actively being targeted by the bandit (can occur in BVR or visual).
* **"DEFENSIVE" Call:** Equivalent to "ENGAGED?" and establishes roles. Requires a response (e.g., "EAGLE 2") to confirm.
* **Example:** "EAGLE 1, DEFENSIVE, BANDIT MY SIX, 6000 FT" followed by "EAGLE 2" from the Support Fighter.
* **Role Swap:** Requires positive communication and will not occur until the defensive fighter is no longer under attack.

##### Offensive

* **Unaware Bandit:** The fighter with the most offensive entry should call "ENGAGED."
* **Reacting Bandit:**  The fighter being reacted to should call "ENGAGED."
* **Example:**  "EAGLE 1, TALLY 1, BRA 020/55, 5000, ENGAGED."
* **Wingman Priority:**  Always strive to be the Engaged Fighter, but the flight lead has final say.

##### Flight Lead as Engaged

* If all other factors are equal and no "ENGAGED" call has been made, the flight lead assumes the role.
* Once the bandit reacts, it should become clear who should call "ENGAGED" based on the above criteria.

##### Support

* **Automatic:** Any fighter not the Engaged Fighter.
* **Role Change:** Only occurs with clear communication confirming the Support Fighter has assumed the Engaged role, including going defensive.

#### Role Exchange

##### Engaged Fighter Offensive/Neutral

* **Support Fighter Actions:** If they have a better entry, call "ENGAGED" to request the role exchange.
* **Maintain Deconfliction:** Until the role swap is confirmed through communication.
* **"ENGAGED" Call Timing:**  Call before potential flight path conflicts and avoid calling too early, which reduces pressure on the bandit.

##### Support Fighter Becomes Defensive

* **Role Swap:**  Occurs when the Support Fighter becomes defensive and can no longer fulfill their responsibilities. Requires communication for confirmation.
* **Exception:** Roles don't need to swap if the Support Fighter can still perform their duties (e.g., if a passing bandit doesn't sustain the attack).

#### Engaged Communication

After an "ENGAGED" call:

* **"PRESS":**  Directive call to the Engaged Fighter to continue the attack. The caller assumes the Support role and responsibility for deconfliction. Roles are swapped.
* **"UNABLE":** Engaged Fighter cannot disengage/assume the Support role without risk or needs to engage another bandit. Roles are not swapped. 
* **"NEGATIVE":** (Flight lead only) Denies the role exchange. The wingman remains the Support Fighter. Roles are not swapped.

#### Flow, Roles Exchanged

* **Confirmed Exchange ("PRESS"):** The newly engaged fighter should exercise caution as the Support Fighter (or other aircraft) deconflicts. Remain predictable and continue clearing your flight path.

#### Flow, No Role Exchange

* **"UNABLE":**  Used by the Engaged Fighter if unable to disengage safely or needs to engage another bandit.
* **Support Fighter Options:**  Maintain deconfliction and flow, but engage if a clear shot becomes available (with flight path deconfliction). Only "UNABLE" can deny a role exchange for a wingman.
* **Flight Lead "NEGATIVE":**  May be used if the Support Fighter is not well-positioned or for other tactical reasons.

#### Special Case Engage/Support Communication

##### Break Turns

* **Default Engaged Fighter:**  The aircraft on the inside of the turn until the bandit's target becomes clear (via pursuit course or RWR).
* **Outside Aircraft:** Easiest flight path deconfliction while maintaining good BFM.
* **Communication:** The pilot who called the break should talk the other fighter onto the bandit until "TALLY" is called.

##### Bandit Switches

* **Indicators:** Bandit nose position (considering radar/heat nose and HMS capabilities) and F-15E spike status. 
* **First to Recognize:** Use directive communication to initiate the appropriate defensive response and provide descriptive commentary.
* **Example:**  "EAGLE 4, BANDIT SWITCHED, ENGAGED."
* **Simplified Role Swap (Optional):**  Flight lead can brief that a "BANDIT SWITCHED" call with acknowledgment from the other fighter constitutes a role exchange (minimizes communication). 

### ACM Communications

#### Importance

* **Maximize Element Potential:**  Clear, concise, accurate communication is essential.
* **Role Establishment/Coordinated Employment:**  Communicate critical information during the engagement to confirm roles and responsibilities.
* **Standard Terminology (Brevity Code):**  Minimizes confusion, enhances SA, and reduces transmission time. Use plain English if standard terminology doesn't fit the situation.
* **Communication Discipline:**
    * Limit communication to essential information.
    * Utilize the auxiliary radio for ACM communication to avoid saturating the tactical frequency.

#### Format

* **Offensive vs. Defensive:**  Determines the communication format.
* **Communication Categories:**
    * Directive
    * Descriptive
    * Informative/SA Building
    * Engaged/Support
* **Engagement Context:** Presented in terms of an engaged element, but applicable to any number of F-15Es involved.

#### Communication Categories

##### Directive Commentary

* **Purpose:** Tell the other fighter what to do.
* **Priority:** Get the element maneuvering quickly to counter the bandit and establish roles. 
* **Format:** Call sign + directive + descriptive commentary.
* **Example:** "EAGLE 1, BREAK RIGHT!" (wingman [Eagle 2] detects a bandit approaching lead's right side).
* **Wingman Directives:**  Requests, subject to flight lead approval/denial. 
* **Flight Lead Directives:**  Commands.

**Example Directive Calls:**

* BREAK (with direction)
* HARD (with direction)
* FLARE
* SEPARATE (with direction)
* JINK
* BLOW THROUGH
* BRACKET
* BUGOUT
* CHECK
* COME BACK
* COME OFF
* CONTINUE
* DEPLOY
* HOOK
* PUSH IT UP
* REFERENCE (with direction)

##### Descriptive Commentary

* **Purpose:** 
    * Provide visual cues ("where to look").
    * Describe the situation.
    * Ask questions.

* **Format:**  Call sign + descriptive element(s).

* **Example:** "EAGLE 1, BANDIT RIGHT 3 O'CLOCK, 2 MILES, LOW."

**Example Descriptive Terms:**

* BANDIT
* BLIND
* BOGEY
* BUDDY LOCK
* FOX
* GREEN
* KILL
* LOCKED
* LOW
* MERGED
* NO JOY
* OFF
* POSIT
* RAYGUN
* SLOW
* STATUS
* SWITCHED
* TALLY
* TRASHED
* VISUAL

##### Informative/Situational Awareness Building Communication

* **Purpose:**  Enhance SA.

**Example Informative Calls:**

* OFFENSIVE/DEFENSIVE
* ANCHORED
* IN/OUT
* SWITCHED
* SPIKE
* SPLIT
* CHECK GAS

**Format:** Call sign + informative term.

##### Plain English

Use clear and concise language if standard terminology is insufficient to convey critical information while prioritizing safety and bandit neutralization.

##### Engaged Communication Format

* **Long-Range:** Use BRA format (e.g., "EAGLE 1, TALLY 1, BRA 020/5, 5000, ENGAGED").
* **Close-Range:**  Use clock position and relative altitude (e.g., "EAGLE 1, TALLY 1, RIGHT 1 O'CLOCK, LOW, ENGAGED").

#### Merge Communication

##### Brevity Terms

* **ANCHORED?:** Anticipating a turn >90° to engage the bandit.
* **DEFENSIVE:**  Aircraft reacting defensively to the bandit (implies soon to be anchored). 
* **ENGAGED:**  Maneuvering to kill the bandit (initiates role establishment). 
* **BREAK:** Directive for an immediate maximum performance turn in the indicated direction (assumes a defensive situation).

##### Brevity Definitions

* **OUT (with direction):**  Turning to a cold aspect relative to the threat (optional in ACM, typically used by the Support Fighter exiting to regain energy).
* **IN (with direction):**  Turning to a hot aspect relative to the threat (optional in ACM, typically used by the Support Fighter returning to the fight).
* **STATUS:**  Request for the other fighter's tactical situation (used to confirm bandit identification). Respond with concise, discriminating information (e.g., "EAGLE 1, HIGH"). 
* **SEPARATE:**  Leaving the engagement (may or may not re-enter).
* **BUGOUT:**  Leaving the engagement/operation with no intent to return.
* **BLIND:** No visual contact with friendly aircraft (opposite of VISUAL).
* **BLOW THROUGH:**  Continuing straight ahead at the merge (not turning with the target).
* **BREAK (with direction):**  Immediate maximum performance turn in the indicated direction (assumes a defensive situation). 
* **DEFENSIVE:**  Aircraft maneuvering defensively in response to an A/A threat. The caller initially assumes the Engaged role when establishing ACM roles. 
* **ENGAGED:**  Maneuvering with intent to kill (initiates role establishment). 
* **FOX:**  Air-to-air weapon launch.
* **HARD (with direction):**  High-G, energy-sustaining turn.
* **MERGE(D):**  Friendlies and targets have entered the same visual arena (radar returns merged).
* **NEGATIVE:**  Denial of the request (flight lead only).
* **NO JOY:**  No visual contact with the target/bandit (opposite of TALLY).
* **POSIT:**  Request for position (respond with clock position, cardinal direction, landmark, or reference point). 
* **SWITCH/SWITCHED:** Bandit is changing targets. 
* **TALLY:**  Visual contact with target/bandit/enemy position (opposite of NO JOY).
* **TUMBLEWEED:** Limited situational awareness, no visual; a request for information. 
* **VISUAL:** Visual contact with a friendly aircraft or ground position (opposite of BLIND). 

**Non-Standard Terms:** The flight lead should brief any terms not found in AFTTP 3-1.

#### Basic Rules for Good Flight Communication

* **Brevity:** Use AFTTP 3-1 brevity code. 
* **Directive-Pause-Descriptive:** Issue a directive, pause to listen and observe, provide descriptive information, and repeat the directive if needed.
* **Clarity:**  Speak slowly and distinctly, considering radio limitations.
* **Active Listening:** Essential for two-way communication and maintaining SA. Minimize intercockpit chatter. 

### Weapons Deconfliction

#### Support Fighter's Concern

Once roles are established, weapons employment often follows. The Engaged Fighter, typically pressuring the bandit or defending nearby, is less concerned with shot deconfliction. However, the Support Fighter must prioritize deconfliction to avoid fratricide. 

#### Guidance

* **AFTTP 3-1, Volume 17:**  Provides specific shot deconfliction doctrine.
* **Simplified Rules of Thumb:** Flight lead may brief these; ensure thorough understanding. 

#### Gun Employment

* **Advantages:** Highly discriminating, all-aspect, minimal range (limited only by debris avoidance). 
* **Disadvantages:**  Requires high concentration and slowing down, which can be risky in a multi-bandit environment.

**Other Weapons:**  Refer to AFTTP 3-1, Volume 17 for AIM-7, AIM-9, and AIM-120 deconfliction criteria.

### Offensive ACM

* **Emphasis:** Two-ship coordination for threat neutralization. 
* **Keys to Success:**  
    * Fulfilling Engaged/Support Fighter contracts. 
    * Formations.
    * Radar search patterns. 
    * Two-ship intercept procedures.
    * Weapons employment. 
    * Merge/post-merge tactics. 
    * BFM skills. 
    * Intraflight communication.

#### Formation/Radar Search

Determined by the flight lead.

#### Intercepts

Primarily single-side offsets (lower aspect targets) and brackets (high aspect targets). 

#### Weapons

Dependent on ROE (VID vs. BVR).

#### Objective

Turn at the merge and kill the bandit quickly using a fluid attack system with clearly defined Engaged/Support roles.

#### Engaged Fighter

Focus on weapons employment and either:

* Killing the bandit. 
* Keeping the bandit predictable.

#### Support Fighter

Maneuver to support the Engaged Fighter, with the primary goal being to kill the bandit and prevent the flight from becoming anchored.

### 2 v 1 Intercepts

#### Pre-Merge Considerations

* Tally acquisition
* Bandit count
* Tactical decision-making
* Friend/foe identification
* Merging with an advantage

#### Common Scenarios

* Remaining bandit after BVR shots. 
* VID requirement on a bogey.

#### VID Situation

* **Basic Intercept Tactics:** Single-side offset or bracket.
* **VID Decision:**  Point at which this discussion joins the intercept.

#### Single-Side Offset (SSO)

* **Unaware/Low Aspect Bogey (<15 AA):** 
    * Stern conversion as an element. 
    * Wingman must achieve separation at the merge for ordnance employment (once the bogey is declared a bandit). 

* **Wingman Actions:**
    * Deploy wider and establish an altitude stack (high/low determined by the bogey's altitude).
    * Aim for a 3-4 nm split to maintain visual and prevent the bogey from reaching minimum range for any WEZs if it turns at the merge.
    * Maintain pure pursuit NLT 7 nm while avoiding gimbal.

* **Element Actions:**
    * Both work for the tally (assume multiple bandits).
    * Wingman maintains both tally and visual for post-merge shot deconfliction.

* **Merge Communication:**
    * Lead's call: "EAGLE 1, ENGAGED, BOGEY" (wingman responds with "EAGLE 2, TALLY" to establish roles).
    * After VID: Lead calls "EAGLE 1, MERGED, HOSTILE, HOSTILE" and the wingman employs ordnance (if deconfliction allows).

[Figure D-1: Single-Side Offset]

#### Post-Merge (SSO)

* **Sufficient Separation/Altitude Split:**  Wingman entry is straightforward regardless of bandit actions. 
* **Bandit Turns Belly Up (Engages Lead):**  Wingman maneuvers for a shot and kills before the following merge. 
* **Bandit Turns Into Wingman (Unaware):**  Wingman employs a front-aspect weapon and follows up with BFM, leveraging established vertical turning room.
* **Wingman Unable to Engage/Kill:**  Continue BFM and call "EAGLE 2, ENGAGED?" if necessary.

#### Bracket

* **Aware/High Aspect Bogey (≥16 AA):** Flight lead may choose to bracket NLT 15 nm.
* **Wingman Actions:**
    * Maneuver away from the bogey's nose and stack opposite the lead to aid the bracket.
    * Force the bogey to look in two directions to deny tally two.
* **Bracket Formation:** 
    * ~4-5 nm wide.
    * Bracket in altitude (if possible).
* **Communication:** "EAGLE 1, BRACKET, BOGEY, BRA 030/20, 15,000."
* **Wingman Responsibilities:**
    * Avoid gimbal while maneuvering.
    * Maintain pure pursuit as soon as possible.
    * Monitor the bogey's aspect and communicate if it commits on the lead (e.g., "EAGLE 1, BOGEY'S HOT ON YOU"). 
* **Lead Turn:**  Wingman effectively lead turns the bogey to gain an advantageous merge position.

[Figure D-2: Bracket]

#### Merge (Bracket)

* **Lead:** Calls "EAGLE 1, ENGAGED" (wingman acknowledges with "EAGLE 2, TALLY").
* **Post-VID:** Lead declares "EAGLE 1, MERGED, HOSTILE, HOSTILE" and the wingman engages with ordnance (if deconflicted). 
* **Wingman Priorities:** Shot deconfliction and employing BFM to kill the bandit.

#### Separation

* **Objective:**  Element separates from the fireball after a kill. 
* **Support Fighter:**  Uses SA to direct a safe heading for separation (lead may refine for tactical rejoin).
* **Primary Goal:**  Leave the fireball area quickly (may attract unwanted attention).
* **Separation Mechanics:**  Best acceleration, visual lookout, and spike awareness.
* **Rejoin:**  Use check turns to regain tactical formation and mutual support.

#### Mutual Support

* **Visual Lookout:**  Essential; avoid getting fixated on cockpit displays and neglecting 360° awareness.
* **Two-Seat Advantage:**  WSO focuses on visual lookout, while the pilot focuses on short-range radar. 

#### Short-Range Radar

* **Initial:**  AUTO GUNS in the direction of separation/turns, clearing the immediate area. 
* **Visual Search:**  Supplement radar with visual checks for threats outside radar coverage. 
* **Acquisition Symbol Placement:**  Maintain accurate placement when slewing to avoid ineffective search areas. 
* **After 10-15 Seconds:**  Switch to SRM (20 nm coverage) and then to MRM once the area is clear. 
* **Radar/Visual Handover:**  Initiate as briefed once the MRM search is complete.

**Key Points:**  Effective separation/bug out includes:

* Controlled separation maneuvers. 
* Re-establishing mutual support.
* Implementing a short-range radar plan.
* Maintaining visual lookout for threats. 

### Post-Merge Maneuvering

#### Options

* **Unaware Bandit:**  Stern entry maneuvers (may include Support Fighter exit and re-entry). Initially practiced from perch setups (Air-to-Air Phase Manual).

* **Aware Bandit:**  High-aspect maneuvering (typically one fighter anchored in a HABFM fight, while the other maneuvers for re-entry or weapons separation). Initially practiced from butterfly OACM setups. 

**Support Fighter Emphasis:** Understanding re-entry mechanics (full re-entry may not always be necessary; prioritize bandit neutralization).

#### Re-entering the Fight as the Support Fighter

##### Support Fighter Position

* **Ideal Range:** 2-5 nm from the fight (denies the bandit a shot while staying close enough to maintain tally/visual). 
* **Avoid:**
    * Extending beyond 5 nm (difficult to see the fight and re-enter).
    * Allowing the fight to drift to your 6 o'clock (risk of losing visual).

* **Flight Path:**
    * Maintain the fight between your 7-10 o'clock or 2-5 o'clock.
    * Series of hard turns and extensions outside the fight.
    * Airspeed: ~425-450 KCAS (near corner velocity).
    * Power:  As needed to maintain energy (4-6 Gs).
    * Extensions: 5-10 seconds maximum (regain/maintain energy and turn unpredictably).

* **Vertical Stack:** No closer than 2,000 feet to the fight (denies bandit tally while preserving turning room). Increased vertical separation is needed closer to the fight. 

#### Support Fighter Re-entries

* **Types:** Co-flow (fan) and counter-flow.
* **Choice Factors:** Fight progression, turning direction, support fighter's position.
* **Priority:** Gain turning room by initially moving away from the fight, then turn back to set up the entry (co-flow or counter-flow based on turn direction).

#### Re-Entry Considerations

* Maintain tally/visual.
* Preserve turning room. 
* Avoid flying in front of the bandit.
* Avoid highlighting yourself.

**General Rule:**  Turn back in a way that:

1. Prevents you from becoming threatened.
2. Maintains tally/visual.
3. Provides the fastest entry/shot. 
4. Allows you to continue in your current turn direction.

**Turn Reversal:** If a change of direction is needed, decide early. Execute a hard turn to place the fight on the opposite side of your tail for quicker tally/visual regain. 

##### Co-Flow Entry

* **Definition:**  Support Fighter enters the fight in the same direction as the bandit.

[Figure D-3: Co-Flow Entry]

* **Advantage:** Reduced line-of-sight, making entry judgment easier. 
* **Disadvantage:** Requires a predictable bandit who hasn't spotted you. 
* **Vertical Turning Room (5,000-8,000 feet):**  Allows co-flow entry from inside the bandit's turn circle. Requires careful airspeed awareness and power management for more vertical entries. 

##### Counter-Flow Entry

* **Definition:** Support Fighter and bandit turn in opposite directions.

[Figure D-4: Counter-Flow Entry]

* **Advantage:** Bandit is less likely to see the Support Fighter (assuming a favorable background and vertical split).
* **Disadvantage:**  Higher closure rate makes entry judgment more challenging. 

#### Judging Re-entries

* **Cues:**  Bandit nose position relative to you and your distance from the fight. 
* **Rule of Thumb:** Start re-entry when the bandit's nose passes your position relative to the fight (assumes ~2-3 nm distance and sufficient altitude separation).
* **Engaged Fighter's BFM:**  Be prepared to react with CMD if the Engaged Fighter's BFM is poor, allowing the bandit to maneuver and threaten you. 

#### Counter-Flow Re-entry Procedure

1. **Bandit Nose Passes:**  Rotate lift vector and lead turn the bandit.
2. **Communication:**  Inform the Engaged Fighter of your intentions (e.g., "EAGLE 2, IN FROM HIGH").
3. **Maneuvering:** In-plane or out-of-plane based on turning room.
4. **HOTAS/Energy Management:**  Critical during the entry. 
5. **Auto Acquisition Mode:** Consider the proximity of the Engaged Fighter and bandit (boresight is the most discriminating).
6. **Alternatives:**  Be ready to retry the radar lock, use a boresight AIM-9, or employ deconflicted shots if necessary.
7. **Airspeed Control:**  Avoid entering too fast or reaching the bandit's turn circle without energy.
8. **"ENGAGED" Call:**  When you can maintain pressure on the bandit and assume Engaged Fighter responsibilities. 
9. **Be Prepared:** For "UNABLE" or "NEGATIVE" calls and the need to maintain deconfliction or provide the flight lead with visual information.
10. **Follow-up BFM:**  Crucial; avoid a fast, high-HCA entry leading to an overshoot.
11. **"UNABLE"/"NEGATIVE":**  Have a plan to abort and reposition for another re-entry.

#### Slow Speed Fight Entry

* **Most Challenging:** Requires precise communication to clarify intent. 
* **Key:** Recognizing the fight is slow speed (enter with excess energy, but not a 300-400 knot advantage). 
* **Initial Positioning:**  Gain perspective on the fight (use "POSIT" or "STATUS" calls to confirm aircraft identification if unsure).
* **Entry:** Aim for a position behind the fight with 45-90° of angle-off (maintains tally/visual, preserves energy, and allows 3/9 control).

[Figure D-5: Reentry into a Slow Speed Fight]

* **Timing/Shot Deconfliction:**  Avoid crossing problems. 
* **"ENGAGED" Call:**  Unnecessary (response would be "UNABLE").
* **Priorities:**  
    * Identify the bandit.
    * Ensure shot deconfliction.
    * Neutralize the bandit quickly.

* **Avoid:**
    * Having three slow aircraft in the same airspace.
    * Dashing through the middle of a slow speed fight.

* **Directive Communication:** May be needed for deconfliction (e.g., "EAGLE 1, COME OFF, HARD RIGHT NOW!").
* **Successful Kill:**  Essential to avoid jeopardizing the flight lead's position.

#### Areas to Avoid as the Support Fighter

* **Directly Below the Fight:** 
    * Descending fight may eliminate your turning room.
    * Energy loss when raising your nose to enter.

* **Within 2 nm (Horizontally):** 
    * Insufficient turning room/G available for ordnance employment.
    * Leads to rushed shots or missed opportunities.
    * Increases risk of bandit attack while the Engaged Fighter is maneuvering. 

#### Entering From Above the Fight

* **Challenge:**  Maintaining situational awareness and avoiding fixation on the fight geometry. Requires experience. 
* **Advantages:** Easier turn circle alignment.
* **Disadvantage:**  Risk of becoming a "high-speed cheerleader" due to difficulty slowing down in a nose-low attitude. 
* **Effective:**  If executed correctly.

#### Re-entry Exercises

##### Bandit Breaks into Support Fighter

* **Best BFM:** Maneuver to the bandit's turn circle for a lag. 
* **Support Fighter Options:** 
    * Co-flow:  Turn in the same direction as the fight (easier to control, but takes longer to develop).
    * Counter-flow: Turn in the opposite direction (quicker re-entry, but more difficult timing).

* **Co-Flow:**  Maintain tally to position the fight at your 5 o'clock. 
* **Counter-Flow:** Use visual on lead to position the fight at your 7 o'clock.
* **Exiting Turn Circle:**  Climb/descend aggressively for out-of-plane separation and gain horizontal turning room by extending away from the fight.

[Figures D-6 and D-7: Co-Flow and Counter-Flow Re-entry Exercise Diagrams]

#### High Aspect ACM Setups

##### Purpose

Simulate more realistic scenarios:

* Aware bandit at merge.
* Short-range element pickup (requiring quick reactions and communication). 

##### Butterfly Setup

* **Initial Communication:**  "SNAPLOCK" or tally-initiated "ENGAGED" call. 
* **Short-Range Engagement Rules:**  Flight lead briefs these. 
* **Role Establishment:**  Essential (wingman typically starts as the Support Fighter in this workbook).
* **Default Engaged Fighter:**  The aircraft merging with the bandit (if not explicitly communicated).
* **Support Fighter:**  Gain a lead turn and fulfill support responsibilities. 

##### Bracket Advantage

Bracketing a high-aspect bandit provides the quickest opportunity for ordnance employment. Prevent the bandit from keeping both fighters on the same side.

##### High Aspect, Bracket, Turn Into, No Switch

* **Support Fighter:** 
    * Gain a lead turn and shoot once the lead is clear (if turning room allows and shot is deconflicted).
    * If turning room is limited or shot deconfliction is a concern, consider using the vertical for a quick kill (be aware of potential deconfliction issues with the Engaged Fighter, who will likely be in a one-circle fight).

* **Engaged Fighter (Lead):** 
    * If unable to escape the neutral fight or becomes anchored/defensive, the wingman must maintain deconfliction while maneuvering to kill. 
    * Slow speed fights require patience for shot deconfliction.

* **Vertical Unavailable:** Support Fighter should plan for a fight exit and re-entry, utilizing slow speed fight re-entry techniques.
* **Separation:**  Expect the fighter in the one-circle fight to need initial straight-ahead separation to gain airspeed. 

[Figure D-8: High Aspect, Bracket, Turn Into, No Switch]

##### High Aspect, Bracket, Turn Into, Switch

* **Bandit Awareness:** Be prepared for the bandit to recognize the Support Fighter and:
    * Minimize the Engaged Fighter's ordnance range.
    * Break defensively into the lead-turning Support Fighter. 
* **Communication:**
    * Any fighter recognizing the switch calls "BANDIT SWITCHED."
    * Support Fighter considers calling "ENGAGED, ANCHORED, ONE-/TWO-CIRCLE" and expects "PRESS" to exchange roles.

* **Post-Switch:**
    * If the bandit continues engaging Eagle 2, Eagle 1 should have a straightforward co-flow entry (if using the vertical effectively). 
    * If the bandit switches back to Eagle 1 for a one-circle fight, another "BANDIT SWITCHED?" call is made, and a role exchange may be needed. Eagle 1 should have extra lead turn, and the Support Fighter should be directed to exit and re-enter.

[Figure D-9: High Aspect, Bracket, Turn Into, Switch]

##### High Aspect, Offset, Turn Into, No Switch

* **Challenge:**  Attacking from an offset presents more difficult choices.
* **Priority:**  Fly best BFM while maintaining deconfliction (emphasize lead turns).
* **Merge:**  May be difficult to determine which fighter the bandit is turning with, requiring clear communication. 
* **Support Fighter:**
    * Utilize lead turn advantage and vertical for a quick shot (if possible).
    * Maintain awareness of flight lead's position for shot deconfliction.
* **Maneuvering to the Control Zone:**
    * May be necessary if a quick shot isn't possible.
    * Deconfliction shifts to the element lead as the Support Fighter becomes the Engaged Fighter. 
    * Be mindful of merge challenges (Figure D-11).

[Figure D-10: High Aspect, Offset, Turn Into, No Switch]

#### Second Merge (Role Exchange)

* **Late Role Swap:** The new Support Fighter (lead) may still need to merge defensively. 
* **Engaged Fighter:**  Maintain SA on both aircraft and deconflict shots until the Support Fighter can separate for re-entry. 

[Figure D-11: Second Merge after Role Exchange]

##### High Aspect, Offset, Turn Into, Switch

* **Disadvantage:**  Both fighters are on the same side of the bandit's canopy, allowing for easier tracking and multiple switches. 

* **Options:**
    * **Two-Circle:** Both fighters turn two-circle, allowing the lead to rate fight for an advantage while the wingman continues looking for a switch opportunity (Figure D-12). May lead to multiple merges, but one fighter should eventually gain an advantage.
    * **One-Circle:**  One fighter takes the bandit single-circle to create a predictable fight and keep the fighters aft of the bandit's 3/9 line (Figure D-13). Requires one fighter to engage closely while the other works for an entry, sorts out who's who, and waits for shot deconfliction.

**Key takeaway:** Many possibilities exist in high-aspect ACM engagements. With proper element coordination and role fulfillment, the bandit should quickly become defensive, even if initially enjoying switching opportunities.

**Fundamental principles:**

* Fly your best BFM.
* Maintain flight path deconfliction.
* Maneuver to kill the bandit.

[Figures D-12 and D-13: High Aspect, Offset, Turn Into, Switch, Two-Circle and One-Circle]

#### Engaging Other Threats

* **Support Fighter's Role:**  Protect the Engaged Fighter, including engaging additional bandits that threaten the fight.
* **Radar Contacts:**  Assess threat level based on range and aspect relative to the fight. 
* **Split Criteria:** Prebriefed guidelines help the Support Fighter decide whether to engage or monitor/drop a new threat (refer to AFTTP 3-1, Volume 17).

#### Separation/Bugout

* **Decision:** Whether to reengage a surviving bandit rests with the flight lead or is dictated by defensive BFM needs.
* **Bugout:**  Prioritize escaping the fireball area, regaining mutual support, and reforming as quickly as possible.

### Defensive ACM

#### Threat Detection

* **Continuous Effort:** Essential for countering short-range attacks. Element members must scan for new bandits and multi-quadrant threats. 
* **Methods:**  Visual, radar, RWR, GCI/AWACS point-outs.
* **Early Visual Acquisition:**  Critical for successful defense.

#### Threat Response

1. **Assessment:** Determine threat range and closure rate.
2. **Out-of-Range Bandits:**  Extend and monitor.
3. **Immediate Threats:**  Counter with initial element maneuvers.

**General Steps:**

* Detect bandit(s).
* Direct an initial move.
* Defeat the attack with proper BFM and AAMD.
* Provide mutual support.
* Gain the offensive or disengage/separate.

#### Two-Ship Defense: Initial Moves

* **Well-Planned and Practiced:** Essential for negating the initial attack.
* **Characteristics:**
    * Aggressive
    * Rotate vulnerable cones away from the threat
    * Simple and easy to remember
    * Instinctive (through practice)

#### Bandit in Aft Quadrant (Missile Range)

* **Avoid:** Both aircraft in the same area simultaneously.
* **Split:**  Laterally and vertically (good tactical formation).
* **Actions:**
    * Fighter with tally: Hard/break turn into the bandit, direct flight maneuver via communication, dispense chaff/flares.
    * Fighter without tally: Turn as directed, dispense preemptive chaff/flares, pull maximum Gs, acquire tally.

#### Hard Turn vs. Break Turn

* **Hard Turn:**
    * Maximum AB for maximum energy.
    * Use when the bandit is maneuvering for a shot but not yet in parameters.
    * Avoid entering a WEZ in full AB.

* **Break Turn:**
    * Mil power or less, chaff/flares dispensed.
    * Use when the bandit is in a position to shoot or has fired.
    * Select AB once the threat is neutralized or outside parameters.

* **Stores Jettison:** Consider if the bandit pursues the attack and the aircraft is configured for it. 

#### Separation Impossibility

* **Objective:** Defeat bandit ordnance, sandwich the bandit and achieve a kill/separation, or force the bandit to separate.
* **Engaged Fighter:** Determined by the bandit's actions. 
* **Support Fighter:** Maneuvers to bring ordnance to bear, but communicates clearly to avoid confusion and maintain deconfliction responsibility. 

### Visual Lookout Responsibilities and Range Estimation

#### Primary Search Areas

[Figure D-14: Primary Areas of Visual Search]

* **Pilot:**  Forward of the 3/9 line.
* **WSO:**  Aft of the 3/9 line.

**Crew Coordination:** Communicate search areas to avoid redundancy (e.g., "I'm outside and to the right").

#### Formation Spread

Adjust based on expected threat size and type, as visibility across the formation decreases with distance. 

#### Range Estimation

[Figure D-15: Visual Lookout Bandit Range Estimation]

* **References:**  Use aircraft references to estimate range behind the leader in line abreast formation.
* **30° Aft:** Just off the inlet ramp.
* **60° Aft:** Just off the trailing edge of the wingtip.
* **45° Aft (Wing Line):** Bandit range behind wingman equals line abreast tactical range (e.g., 9,000 feet separation = 9,000 feet behind wingman). 
* **Key:**  Determine if the bandit is within a WEZ to decide on the appropriate response.

### Bandit Attack Options

1. **No Switch:** Attacks one fighter and doesn't switch.
2. **Early Switch:**  Initiates a switch before losing 3/9 line advantage on the initial target.
3. **Late Switch:**  Switches after crossing the new target's 3/9 line. 
4. **Uncommitted Bandit:**  Position doesn't clearly indicate the target. 

#### No Switch

* **Response:** Both Eagles break into the bandit (Figure D-16).
* **Engaged Fighter:**  Flies defensive BFM.
* **Support Fighter:** 
    * Flies offensive BFM to employ a missile. 
    * Exercise caution to avoid fratricide, especially after 90-120° of turn when shot opportunities arise.
* **Separation:** Difficult unless the bandit attempts a high-angle snapshot; Support Fighter must be prepared to continue BFM if a quick kill is not possible. 

[Figure D-16: No Switch]

#### Early Switch

* **Example:** Attacks Eagle 2, then switches to Eagle 1 before losing 3/9 line advantage (Figure D-17).
* **Response:** 
    * Eagle 1 calls "BANDIT SWITCHED."
    * Eagle 2 continues turning until tally, then extends for energy/turning room, gets out of plane, and sets up an entry (co-flow or counter-flow).

* **Separation:** Typically not possible. 

[Figure D-17: Early Switch]

#### Late Switch

* **Example:** Attacks Eagle 1, then switches to Eagle 2 after crossing Eagle 2's 3/9 line (Figure D-18).
* **Response:** 
    * Eagle 1 breaks as directed and attempts to acquire tally.
    * Eagle 2 breaks into the bandit.
    * Eagle 2 calls "BANDIT SWITCHED" upon the switch and merges 180° out with the bandit for separation (if possible).
* **Separation:** 
    * Often possible if Eagle 2 flies good BFM.
    * Typically results in a 1-3 nm echelon/trail formation.
    * Eagle 2 maintains tally during separation to decide whether to continue or react defensively again. 

* **Element Objective:**  Separate and leave, or create enough distance to re-engage the bandit at high aspect. 

[Figure D-18: Late Switch]

#### Uncommitted Bandit

* **Assessment:** Quickly determine threat level based on range and nose position. 
* **Options:**
    * **Out of Parameters:**  Extend while monitoring.
    * **Threatening:**  Immediate flight reaction required.

#### Initial Move Objectives (Uncommitted Bandit)

* Deny the bandit a shot. 
* Present maximum BFM challenges.
* Force the bandit to commit to a target. 
* Maximize element offensive potential.
* Establish clear Engaged/Support roles. 

#### Same Direction Break vs. Cross-Turn

##### Same Direction

* **Advantages:**
    * Outside fighter maintains tally throughout. 
    * Forces immediate bandit commitment.
    * Creates unequal offensive potential against each fighter.
    * Establishes defensive and support roles based on bandit reaction. 
    * Simplifies flight path deconfliction. 
    * Isolates the threat to one side of each aircraft. 

##### Cross-Turn (Hard-to-Six)

* **Disadvantages:**
    * Both fighters in the same airspace, allowing the bandit to delay target selection.
    * More difficult initial deconfliction.
    * May occur unintentionally due to simultaneous break calls or confusion during high-stress situations.

**Recommendation:** If a cross-turn happens, continue the turn and prioritize deconfliction.

#### Bandit at Mutual Six

* **General Rule:** Both fighters turn into the bandit. 
* **Communication:**
    * Fighter with tally initiates the break call (e.g., "EAGLE, BREAK RIGHT").
    * If a fighter assesses the bandit is threatening their wingman, they can call for a break in the opposite direction (e.g., "EAGLE X, BREAK LEFT/RIGHT").
* **Key:** Initiate movement and communicate as soon as the bandit is detected.
