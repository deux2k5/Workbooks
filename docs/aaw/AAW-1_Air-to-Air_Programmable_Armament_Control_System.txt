PACS DISPLAY

The PACS display is accessible in both cockpits on the MPD/MPCD. It is
the part of the armament control system that is most used. Through it,
the aircrew can identify munitions on the stations, program firing/delivery
options, etc., and then monitor and release. Also, if desired, it is possible
to set up a training program to simulate all of the above.

Top Level PACS Menu
ARMT (armament) is one of the choices on MPD/MPCD Menu 1 and is

where to start. By pressing PB #2, the top level PACS menu is called up
(Figure D-3).

MC/DT™

The MC/DTM has the capability of inputting the following A/A data for
the PACS into the computers.

e Gun rounds

e Gun ammo type

e A/A missile loading/identification

e MRM RMNVR

e CBT jettison programs

e AIM-120 flight member ID options
A/G stores data for the PACS will be covered in other lessons.
If the MC/DTM loads properly, all there is to do is check the data
afterwards. Alternately, the aircrew can manually input PACS

information.

NOTE
The CC will not accept MC/DTM PACS weapon loading data unless both

the A/A and A/G modes are in the combat configuration (A/A TRNG and
A/G TRNG unboxed on the ARMT menu).

WEAPONS CONTROLS
Besides the PACS display, there are several other weapons controls.
Master Modes

A/A missiles can be fired in any master mode except A/G. A/G weapons
can only be delivered in A/G master mode. The trigger (FCP) is hot in all
master modes, if the gun is electrically and mechanically armed and the
master arm switch isin ARM. However, the gun will not fire unless both
the A/A and A/G PACS modes are in CMBT.

Armament Control Panel
The armament control panel (ACP), located in the front cockpit in the

lower left corner of the instrument panel, contains the selective jettison
knob/button and the master arm switch (Figure D-4).

ARMAMENT CONTROL
PANEL

Figure D - 4. Armament Control Panel.
Selective Jettison Knob/Button

The “knob” or outer part of this control rotates to select either a jettison
function or an alternate/manual release function. Pressing the “button,”
or inner part, releases stores depending on the position of the knob. Only
the OFF, COMBAT, and A/A positions are relevant for A/A weapons.
These functions are explained later in this lesson.

AAW-1 D-8


Text from AAW-1_Air-to-Air_Programmable_Armament_Control_System_page_15.jpeg:
Master Arm Switch

This lever-lock switch has two positions: SAFE and ARM (pull out, then
up over detent to select ARM). In SAFE, weapons cannot be employed
normally. In ARM, with the landing gear handle up or the armament
safety switch in OVERRIDE, power is provided for weapons employment
and gun firing. With ARM selected, a gun cross is displayed on the
HUD/HUD repeater and the RCP master arm green advisory light
illuminates.

Emergency Jettison Button

The emergency jettison or “panic” button is located in the front cockpit to
the left of the MPCD (Figure D-5). Pushing it once, with electrical power
on the aircraft, jettisons all carted stores and pylons, both on the ground
and in the air. The button must be held in for the duration of the jettison
sequence. If the button should get stuck in the jettison position, yellow
appears between the button and the black faceplate. Normally, only black
is visible around the button. The panic button is “hot” anytime electrical
power (ground power, emergency generator power, or main generator
power) is applied to the aircraft, regardless of the landing gear handle
position and weight on wheels.

Weapons Select Switch

This switch, located on the right throttle in the front cockpit, has three
positions: MRM, SRM, and GUN (Figure D-6). The MRM position allows
firing of either AIM-7 or AIM-120 air-to-air missiles and the SRM position
allows firing of AIM-9 missiles. The GUN (aft) position selects the A/A
master mode and gives the pilot command of the air-to-air radar.

Weapons Release (Pickle) Button

A pickle button is located on both control stick grips (Figure D-7). When
pressed, this red button releases A/G weapons if all other logic is satisfied
and the master arm switch is in ARM. You must be in the A/G master
mode for the pickle button (both cockpits) to drop bombs. If you are in any
other master mode the pickle button (FCP only) launches missiles.

the VTR; squeezing it to the second detent runs the VTR and if the master
arm switch is in ARM, fires the gun, regardless of the position of the
weapon select switch (if both the A/A and A/G PACS are in the CMBT
mode vice TRNG).

Armament Safety Switch

This two-position toggle switch is located in the FCP on the left console
outboard of the G-suit connection (Figure D-8). In the SAFE position,
weapons release (except via the panic button) is inhibited with the gear
handle down. In OVERRIDE (electrical power required to hold it there),
the landing gear handle safety circuit is bypassed.

Text from AAW-1_Air-to-Air_Programmable_Armament_Control_System_page_19.jpeg:
A/A PACS

The PACS is loaded manually or through the MC/DTM and is used to
accept digital data and interface signals from associated aircraft
equipment to perform the following:

e Selection, prelaunch preparation, launch, and jettison of A/A missiles

e OWS interface for proper computation of aircraft “G” loading
conditions

e CC interface for the display of accurate missile launch envelopes on
both the HUD and the radar.

For all of the above reasons, it is imperative that the programmed load
accurately reflects the actual aircraft configuration. To ensure this, the
PACS is used to do three things: verify, program, and monitor an A/A
weapons load.

A/A WEAPONS LOAD VERIFICATION

To verify that the PACS recognizes actual A/A configuration, turn on an
MPD/MPCD after engine start and select Menu 1 (Figure D-9, left), then
depress PB #2 (ARMT). This will get you to the top level PACS menu
(Figure D-9, right). This menu allows you to access major weapons
related options available for A/A training or combat mission operation.
Next, press PB #8 to display the “A/A COMBAT WEAPON LOAD?” display
(Figure D-9, bottom). This display reflects what the PACS recognizes as
currently loaded on the aircraft.

Text from AAW-1_Air-to-Air_Programmable_Armament_Control_System_page_21.jpeg:
With A/A missiles loaded, the display will initialize with missiles indicated
on the appropriate CFT stations or wing pylon stations (Figure D-10)
according to the following logic:

AIM-120: The AIM-120 exists in three variants: the A, B, and C.
The CC recognizes all three and will automatically identify the
correct type of missile and display it at the appropriate station on the
PACS display. AIM-120B/C missiles have an expanded weapon
identifier that is displayed directly below the missile type. For
example, TO7R06 identifies missile tape 07, revision 06 for
AIM-120C. Once identified, the AIM-120 type cannot be changed on
the A/A combat weapon load display. This is further emphasized by
the fact that there are no wire diagrams leading from the
pushbutton(s) to the loaded AIM-120 station (Figure D-11). On the
PACS, AIM-120s can appear on CFT stations 3C, 4C, 6C, and 7C,
and can also be loaded on wing pylon stations 2A, 2B, 8A, and 8B
(Figure D-10).

AIM-7: The AIM-7 exists in three variants: the F, M, and MH. The
CC will automatically identify the F and M versions (although some
early production AIM-7Ms identify as AIM-7Fs). However, if an
AIM-7MH is loaded, the aircrew must cycle through the appropriate
station pushbutton, (Figure D-9, PBs #6 and #10) in order to have the
PACS identify and display the H variant. AIM-7s will only appear on
CFT stations 3C, 4C, 6C, and 7C.

AIM-9: The AIM-9 exists in three variants: the P, L, and M. If an
AIM-9P series missile is loaded, the display will initialize with 9P3 at
the station. The station pushbutton will cycle between 9P3
(AIM-9P-2/P-3) and 9J (AIM-9P/P-1). If AIM-9L/Ms are loaded, the
display will initialize with 9L. Pressing the station pushbutton cycles
between 9L and 9M. AIM-9s will only appear on wing pylon stations
2 and 8.

M61A1 GUN: The gun rounds remaining count is displayed adjacent
to PB #1 (Figure D-9). Pressing the appropriate rounds pushbutton
(PB #1 or #2) will change the rounds remaining by either hundreds or
tens of rounds. The HUD will repeat the quantity set in the PACS
when A/A gun mode is selected. Pressing PB #20 cycles between
PGU-28 and M56 bullet types. This applies to actual or training
loads.

A/A TRAINING WEAPONS LOAD PROGRAMMING

Once you have verified that the PACS has correctly identified your actual
A/A weapons load, you can program a specific load for training purposes
by using the MC/DTM load you prepared during premission planning, or
by manually loading it through the PACS. The A/A TRAINING WEAPON
LOAD page is displayed in one of two ways, either by pressing PB #14
(A/A TRNG “boxed”) on the top level PACS menu, then pressing PB #8
(A/A LOAD), or by pressing PB #14 (“boxing” A/A TRNG) while on the A/A
COMBAT WEAPON LOAD display (Figure D-12). The “A/A TRAINING
WEAPON LOAD” display will now appear. Pressing the wing pylon
station pushbuttons will sequence the appropriate station through 9L,

9M, 9P3, 9J, 120A, 120B, 120C, blank, and back to 9L. Pressing the MRM
station pushbuttons will sequence the appropriate station through 7F,

7M, 7MH, 120A, 120B, 120C, blank, and back to 7F.

WARNING

The A/A TRNG mode should not be used
to simulate the release of A/A stores when
live A/A stores are loaded or when A/G
stores are loaded on the same station(s).
The A/A TRNG mode is authorized when
no live A/A stores are loaded and no A/G
stores are loaded on the same station(s).
The cold gun safing procedures in section
II (TO 1F-15E-34-1-1) may be used in lieu
of removing the rounds from the gun.

Text from AAW-1_Air-to-Air_Programmable_Armament_Control_System_page_26.jpeg:
To monitor the new A/A TRAINING WEAPON LOAD, ensure A/A TRNG
is boxed (PB #14), press PB #11 (MENU) (Figure D-13A), then press A/A
(PB #2) (Figure D-13B). Also, the entire training load can be reinitialized
by pressing PB #14 (RESET) (Figure D-13C).

NOTE

The A/A TRNG mode is automatically deselected when any jettison
function or manual free-fall or retard (MAN FF/RET) is selected on the
armament control panel selective jettison knob. Although you can

program CBT JETT options into the training PACS, DO NOT “practice”
the capability, or any selected stores will be jettisoned if they are carted
and otherwise jettisonable. Pylons have actually been inadvertently
jettisoned in this way.

A/A COMBAT WEAPON LOAD MONITORING

To monitor the status of your actual A/A combat weapon load, press

PB #14 (A/A TRNG “unboxed”) (Figure D-14A) or press PB #14 (A/A
TRNG unboxed) and then PB #8 (A/A load) (Figure D-14B). Figure D-14C
reflects a possible weapons load seen at F-15E Formal Training Unit
(FTU).

NOTE

Remember that the PACS self-identifies most, but not all, of the various
AIM-120, AIM-7 and AIM-9 missile mods. Therefore, it is important to
know what variants of these missiles are loaded so that the PACS can be

programmed to reflect the correct missile load. Identifying the missile
load in the combat mode is as previously mentioned in the A/A training
section, with the exception that “A/A TRNG” at PB #14 should be
“unboxed!”

AIM-9L/M Legends

The THLD, SCAN, and COOL options (PBs #2, #8, and #13, respectively)
are boxed when selected (Figure D-16). The THLD and SCAN options
appear only when an AIM-9L/M is aboard and SRM is selected. The
substitution of STBY for an SRM legend on the priority station is another
indicator that SRM has been selected on the throttle and identifies the
priority AIM-9 for launch. A FAIL ID legend indicates a missile loaded
but the PACS cannot determine if the missile is an AIM-9/DAIS or
AIM-120. The missile is deleted from the launch sequence.

The COOL option appears with an AIM-9L or M aboard regardless of
weapon selection on the throttle. When the master arm switch is in ARM
(gear handle up), COOL is automatically selected and boxed. A boxed
RDY legend appears above the missile in launch priority (replacing STBY)
(Figure D-16) when the master arm switch is in ARM and the weapon
select switch is in SRM. An AIM-9L/M can also be manually cooled at any
time by selecting the cool option at PB #18.

Should a missile be launched (or jettisoned), the station legend goes blank.
HUNG is displayed whenever a missile fails to launch/jettison.

The PACS automatically selects the next missile in the firing sequence.
The aircrew can select a different station (including a different type AIM-9
if there is a mixed load of AIM-9Ms, -9Ls, and/or -9Ps by using the missile
reject switch. Missile reject is accomplished by moving the FCP boat
switch aft or RCP castle switch right.

AIM-7/AIM-120 Legends

STBY replaces the AIM-7F/M/MH MRM legend once the missile has
tuned. For the AIM-120, STBY indicates AIM-120 BIT complete. DGRD
denotes AIM-120 BIT complete, but the missile is degraded. The PACS
automatically places the degraded missile(s) last in launch priority. If an
AIM-120 fails the BIT, the FAIL-120A legend appears and the missile is
locked out of the launch sequence. If an AIM-7 fails to tune or detunes, it
is locked out of the launch sequence. FAIL ID indicates both an AIM-9
and AIM-120 missile identification signal present on the same station.
The missile is deleted from the firing sequence. HUNG is displayed
whenever a missile fails to launch/jettison.

A boxed RDY legend replaces STBY above the AIM-7 or AIM-120 missile
in launch priority when master arm is selected and the weapons select
switch is in MRM (Figures D-17 and D-18).

The aircraft CC determines the displayed target size based on an aircrew
manual input or an automatic selection. This is done at PB #2. The
automatic selection is based on target sizes corresponding to tables as
defined in TO 1F-15E-34-1-1-1. Target size is sent to AIM-120Bs and Cs
when the expanded ident is greater than Tape 5 Revision 2 and up for the
AIM-120B and Tape 7 Revision 6 and up for AIM-120C. Earlier
AIM-120Bs or Cs and AIM-120As do get the target size algorithm. The
target size selection influences the AIM-120 fuze timing and is also sent to
the AIM-7MH for fuzing calculations.

Text from AAW-1_Air-to-Air_Programmable_Armament_Control_System_page_33.jpeg:
With MRM selected on the weapons select switch and MRMs loaded on
the aircraft, SAUT XXX is displayed at PB #2. This option allows the pilot
to choose the target size estimate to be provided. With SAUT selected, the
radar will automatically select a target size and report back whether it is
SML, MED, LRG, or HOH, and display it under SAUT at PB #2 based on
information it sees from the target return. More discussion is available in
TO 1F-15E-34-1-1-1. The default setting at PB #2 is SAUT MED.

If PB #2 is toggled, the target size is manually set by the aircrew to either
SMED, SSML, SLRG, or HOH, which will appear in the place of SAUT.
The last setting for PB #2 will remain in the CC until changed either
manually on the display or through entering from the MC/DTM.

A similar selection but for radar cross section instead of target size is
available at PB #8. RAUT is the automatic selection, and RMED, RSML,
and RLRG are manual selections. For more information on the details of
the available settings refer to TO 1F-15E-34-1-1-1.

PB #4 can be used to enter a flight number ID on the PACS when an
AIM-120 is on board and MRM is selected on the throttle weapon switch.
This selection is designed to prevent missile-to-missile mutual
interference between AIM-120s launched by aircraft in the same flight.
The option initializes at 1/1, or 1 aircraft of a 1-ship flight. Pressing

PB #4 cycles between 1/1, 1/2, 2/2, 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, etc., to select your
flight position in a 2-ship or 4-ship flight. These settings can also be
entered via the MC/DTM.

With the weapon select switch in MRM (AIM-120s loaded), TRNG mode
not selected, and the master arm switch in SAFE, SEL BIT is displayed at
PB #5 allowing a BIT of individual AIM-120 missiles.

With the master arm switch on, MODS is displayed at PB #5 in place of
the SEL BIT. Refer to TO 1F-15E-34-1-1-1 for additional information.

Text from AAW-1_Air-to-Air_Programmable_Armament_Control_System_page_34.jpeg:
PBs #6-10 are blank.

With AIM-120s loaded on the aircraft and CMBT PACS selected, the
telemetry (TM PWR) option is displayed (initialized unboxed) next to

PB #15. Pressing PB #15 selects the option and sends telemetry power to
all loaded AIM-120s (Figure D-17). The telemetry option is only
functional with instrumented AIM-120s or CATM-120s.

PB #12 will display A/G on all of the air-to-air PACS pages. Selecting this
button will switch the PACS to the air-to-ground monitor page.

PB #18 will display COOL and will be boxed if the master arm is on and
AIM-9L or Ms are loaded on the aircraft, no matter what position the
throttle weapons select switch is in.

Figure D-17 depicts the AIM-120 launch sequence and Figure D-18
depicts the AIM-7 launch sequence. Normally, the AIM-120s on stations 2
and 8 are launched from the wings first in order of left outboard (2A),
right outboard (8B), left inboard (2B), and right inboard (8A), followed by
those loaded on the CFT stations in the order of left aft (4C), right aft
(6C), left forward (8C), and right forward (7C). AIM-7s on the CFT
stations, however, are launched in the order of left forward (8C), right
forward (7C), left aft (4C), and right aft (6C) (if AIM-7s are the same type).
The PACS will initialize a mixed AIM-7/AIM-120 load with AIM-120s in
priority. The launch sequence for a mixed load of MRMs is AIM-120,
AIM-7MH, AIM-7M, and AIM-7F, regardless of which station the missiles
are loaded on. With a mixed load of MRMs, missile reject cycles from
AIM-120, to AIM-7MH, AIM-7M, AIM-7F, and back to AIM-120.

A/A JETTISON PROCEDURES

There are three ways to jettison A/A weapons from the F-15E: emergency
jettison, combat jettison, and selective jettison. The following discusses
each in greater detail.

Emergency Jettison

The emergency jettison button (Figure D-20) can be used to jettison the
contents of all carted CFT stations (including any AIM-7s/AIM-120s) and
all pylons (including any AIM-9s/AIM-120s loaded) on stations 2 and 8.
The button is “hot” anytime the aircraft is on internal or external power,
and must be held in for approximately 1 second to complete a full load,
unarmed, jettison sequence.

WARNING

Aircrews should exercise extreme caution
to prevent an inadvertent ground-level
jettison of all aircraft stores. Although
the emergency jettison button is
spring-loaded to the normal position (only
black seen on the inside lip of the button
guard), it can stick in the jettison/
depressed position. This will be indicated
by observing yellow inside the switch
guard below the black.

Programming Combat Jettison

Combat jettison gives you the capability to jettison preprogrammed
aircraft stores in a combat situation. Programming is accomplished in
accordance with the procedures in Figure D-21. This mode is “hot”
whenever the landing gear handle is up or the armament safety switch is
in override. From Figure D-21, note that CFT (or fuselage) loaded MRMs
cannot be jettisoned using CBT JETT. Pylon mounted AIM-9s/AIM-120s
can be jettisoned only by jettisoning the pylon. Reference warning below,
cycling the combat jettison knob off and back to COMBAT will not reset
the program to CBT 1.

WARNINGS

Each selection of the CBT JETT display
reinitializes the two-push sequence and
resets the first push of the selective
jettison button to the CBT 1 program,
even if the CBT 1 programmed racks,
stores, or pylons have already been
jettisoned.

The combat jettison program is displayed
in TRNG and is reprogrammable for the
TRNG mode display. However, when
CBT JETT is performed, the system exits
TRNG mode and jettisons actual stores
and pylons loaded and programmed in the
CMBT mode.

System Failures

CC Failure

CC failure results in the loss of the PACS display format and many PACS
capabilities. However, with a CC failure the PACS defaults to an A/A
mode with the following operable functions/capabilities:

Master arm

FCP weapons release (pickle) button

AIM-120 no capability, missile will hang
AIM-7 no weapons parameters or shoot cue
AIM-9 boresight or uncaged, self-tracking shot

M61A1 GUN fires normally, but you cannot select firing rate or set
rounds count

Air-to-air and air-to-ground selective jettison (but no CBT JETT)

Emergency jettison

WARNING

Selecting MAN FF or RET puts the PACS
in the A/G mode and pressing the FCP or
RCP pickle button will release A/G stores
only.

Corrective Action

Attempt to reset the CC in accordance with Dash 1 checklist procedures.
If this does not fix the problem, adjust the mission to compensate or abort.

D-37 AAW-1


Text from AAW-1_Air-to-Air_Programmable_Armament_Control_System_page_44.jpeg:
PACS Failure

In addition to the degraded PACS capability with CC failure, the PACS
can also fail on its own. PACS processor failure is indicated by the
following:

e = Little ordnance related data available on the HUD and none on the
A/A radar. (CC relies on PACS processor for weapons data.)

@e Unable to get ARMT (PACS) display on any MPD/MPCD.
e AIM-120s, AIM-7s, and AIM-9s cannot be launched.

e M61A1 GUN operates normally, but the rounds count and firing rate
cannot be set or monitored.

e Jettison - only the emergency jettison option is available to jettison
ordnance.

Corrective Action

Cycling the PACS switch on the ground power panel to OFF and back to
AUTO may fix the problem. If not, adjust the mission to compensate or
abort.

Master Arm Switch Failure

If the HUD gun cross remains visible after selecting master arm SAFE,
the weapons release button and trigger circuits are armed.

Corrective Action

Select GUN on the weapon select switch. This inhibits MRM/SRM launch
and inhibits an A/G weapons release program. However, the gun fire
circuit remains hot, so the trigger must be avoided. When the landing
gear handle is placed down, the gun cross should be removed.

The WSO may deactivate the gun trigger and master arm logic by pulling

circuit breakers J3 (trigger) and/or K3 (master arm) on the right aft circuit
breaker panel.

INTRODUCTION

The programmable armament control system (PACS) provides the
capability for load, release programming, arming, monitoring,
releasing/firing and jettison of air-to-surface and air-to-air munitions. The
system is made up of computers and processors (CC, MPDP, PACS),
wiring, displays, controls, and carriage stations. It is software
programmable which allows for easy updating and has an extensive
built-in test (BIT) feature which isolates faults down to the specific
module for simplified, rapid repair. This lesson addresses the cockpit
components: the PACS display and the armament controls. Information
presented is primarily about air-to-air. Air-to-ground and nuclear
operations are covered in separate lessons.

To understand the PACS display, it is necessary to know the designations
for the munitions carriage locations. As on all aircraft, the F-15E
weapons stations are numbered left to right (Figure D-1). There is also a
detailed side view of the left CFT weapon stations (Figure D-2).

Figure D - 2. Left CFT Stations.

Here are a few generalizations of what can go where. Wing stations 2 and
8 can carry wing tanks, air-to-ground or air-to-air munitions or a
combination of each. When referencing air-to-air missiles on stations 2 or
8, A and B are used to depict the location. A is the left rail on the station
and B is the right rail on that station. Station 5 is authorized to carry
only air-to-surface munitions, AN/ALQ-14 (data link pod), and fuel tanks.
CFT missile stations are for medium range missiles; if missiles are loaded
on a CFT, the six tangential stations on that CFT cannot be used for A/G
munitions. CFT stations designated “LC” and “RC” on the PACS display
refer to all the CFT stations capable of carrying A/G munitions. When a
CFT is loaded with any A/G munitions, missile carriage on that CFT is
precluded. Refer to TO 1F-15E-1, Chapter 5 for current limitations on
carriage and combinations of weapons loads on the aircraft.
