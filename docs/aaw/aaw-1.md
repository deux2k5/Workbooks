### Introduction

The PACS enables:

* Loading
* Programming release sequences
* Arming
* Monitoring
* Releasing/firing
* Jettisoning

of both air-to-surface and air-to-air munitions. The system comprises:

* Computers and processors (CC, MPDP, PACS)
* Wiring
* Displays
* Controls
* Carriage stations

Key features:

* Software programmability for easy updates.
* Extensive Built-In Test (BIT) for fault isolation and streamlined repair.

This lesson focuses on the cockpit components:

* PACS display
* Armament controls

**Focus:** Primarily on air-to-air operations. Air-to-ground and nuclear operations are covered separately.

#### Understanding Munitions Carriage Locations

Understanding the F-15E weapons station designations is essential for interpreting the PACS display.

* **Numbering:** Stations are numbered left to right (Figure D-1).

[Figure D-1: Loadable Stations]

* **Left CFT Stations:** Detailed view in Figure D-2.

[Figure D-2: Left CFT Stations]

#### Station Usage

* **Wing Stations 2 and 8:** Accommodate wing tanks, air-to-ground munitions, air-to-air munitions, or a combination.
    * **A/A Missile Designation:**  "A" for left rail and "B" for right rail (e.g., 2A, 8B).
* **Station 5:** Carries air-to-surface munitions, AN/ALQ-14 (data link pod), and fuel tanks only.
* **CFT Stations:** 
    * Designed for medium-range missiles (MRMs).
    * Using CFT missile stations prevents loading A/G munitions on the six tangential stations of that CFT.
    * **PACS Display:** "LC" and "RC" represent all CFT stations capable of carrying A/G munitions.
* **A/G Munitions on CFT:**  Precludes missile carriage on that CFT.
* **Carriage Limitations:**  Refer to TO 1F-15E-1, Chapter 5 for current restrictions on weapons carriage and load combinations.

### PACS Display

The PACS display is accessible in both cockpits on the MPD/MPCD. It is the primary interface for:

* Identifying munitions on stations
* Programming firing/delivery options
* Monitoring and releasing weapons
* Setting up training programs (simulated load/release)

##### Methods

1. Emergency Jettison
2. Combat Jettison
3. Selective Jettison

##### Emergency Jettison

* **Activation:** Emergency jettison button (Figure D-20).
* **Jettison Items:** 
    * All carted CFT stations (including AIM-7s/AIM-120s).
    * All pylons on stations 2 and 8 (including AIM-9s/AIM-120s). 

* **Activation Conditions:**  Aircraft is on internal or external power.
* **Duration:** Hold button for ~1 second for a full, unarmed jettison sequence.

**Warning:**

* Exercise caution to avoid inadvertent ground jettison.
* The button can stick in the depressed position (indicated by yellow color inside the switch guard).

[Figure D-20: Jettison Controls]

##### Programming Combat Jettison

* **Function:**  Allows for jettisoning pre-programmed stores in combat.
* **Programming:**  See Figure D-21 for procedures.
* **Activation Conditions:**  Landing gear handle up or armament safety switch in OVERRIDE.
* **CFT-Loaded MRMs:** Cannot be jettisoned using CBT JETT. 
* **Pylon-Mounted AIM-9s/AIM-120s:**  Jettison only by jettisoning the pylon. 

**Warning:**

* Each CBT JETT display selection re-initializes the two-push sequence and resets the first button press to the CBT 1 program (even if CBT 1 stores have already been jettisoned). 
* The combat jettison program is displayed and programmable in the TRNG mode, but executing CBT JETT exits TRNG mode and jettisons actual stores based on the CMBT mode program.

[Figure D-21: Programming Combat Jettison]

##### A/A Selective Jettison

* **Function:** Jettison specific A/A stores selected on the PACS MPD/MPCD using the selective jettison button. 
* **Procedure:**  See Figure D-22.
* **Activation Conditions:** Landing gear handle up or armament safety switch in OVERRIDE.
