### M61A1 Gun Description

* **Type:** Air-cooled, six-barrel Gatling gun.
* **Firing Rate:** Selectable (4,000 or 6,000 rounds per minute).
* **Mechanism:** Rotary action contained within a fixed rear housing.
* **Components:** Six bolts, firing cam path, clearing cam path, rotating barrel cluster.
* **Location:** Right wing root.
* **Cant Angle:**  2° up from the FRL (Fuselage Reference Line).
* **Dispersion:** 8 mils.

#### Major System Components

* Gun
* Ammunition container
* Conveyor assemblies
* Hydraulic power and gearbox assemblies

### 20mm Information/Description

#### 20mm Ammunition

* **Components:** Brass cartridge case, electric primer, propellant powder, projectile (Figure D-1).

[Figure D-1: 20mm Ammunition]

* **Firing Sequence:**
    1. Electrical pulse applied to the primer.
    2. Primer flame ignites the propellant through a gas vent.
    3. Burning propellant creates gas that propels the projectile out of the barrel.

* **Muzzle Velocity:**
    * M-56: 3,300 FPS (feet per second).
    * PGU-28:  3,375 FPS.

#### Projectile Types

##### TP (Target Practice)/TP-T (Tracer)

* **M55A1/M55A2 (TP):**  Hollow, steel projectiles used for practice.
* **M220 (TP-T):**  Same as M55, but with a tracer.

##### API (Armor Piercing Incendiary)

* **M53:** Steel projectile with an incendiary composition, used against armored targets.
* **Function:** Combined penetration and incendiary effects. 
* **Fuze:**  None (incendiary initiated by impact). 

##### HEI/HEI-T (Tracer)

* **M56 (HEI):** High-explosive incendiary cartridge used against aircraft and light material targets (Figure D-2).

[Figure D-2: HEI Cartridge]

* **Function:** Combined detonation and incendiary effects upon impact.
* **Fuze:** Mechanical point-detonating system with an aluminum cover (crushes on impact).
* **Arming:** 
    1. In-barrel: Acceleration and friction forces on the ball rotor and c-ring prevent detonator movement.
    2. Muzzle exit: Decreased acceleration and projectile spin rate (> 49,800 RPM) cause the c-ring to open due to centrifugal force. 
    3. Detonator aligns with the firing pin and booster charge (arming complete 20-35 feet from the aircraft).
* **Explosion Delay:** 300 milliseconds (allows for penetration of truck-type targets).

##### PGU-27/B TP (Target Practice)

* **Replacement:** For the M55 cartridge.
* **Composition:** Inert projectile with a steel body and solid aluminum alloy nose (Figure D-3).
* **Propellant:**  WC867 (modified version of the WC872). 

[Figure D-3: PGU-27B TP Projectile]

* **Advantages:**
    * Reduced drag (~33%).
    * Increased velocity (36% at 1,000 meters).
    * Decreased time of flight (39% at 1,000 meters). 
* **Compatibility:** No changes required to the gun, ammo handling, or storage equipment. 

##### PGU-28/B SAPHEI (Semi-Armor Piercing High Explosive Incendiary)

* **Replacement:**  For the M56 HEI projectile.
* **Composition:** Machined from 15B27 steel bar stock and hardened for improved performance against lightly armored targets (Figure D-4).
* **Components:**  Two incendiary compounds, high explosive, zirconium pellet, copper rotating band, aluminum nose and support disk.

[Figure D-4: PGU-28/B SAPHEI Projectile]

* **Function:**
    1. Impact: Type I nose incendiary ignites. 
    2. Nose incendiary ignites the Type II body incendiary.
    3. Body incendiary initiates the high explosive.
    4. Delay from burning pyrotechnic material allows for target penetration. 
    5. High explosive detonation splinters the projectile body and ignites the zirconium pellet, providing a sustained spark for improved fire-starting.

##### Sequence

1. **Round Pickup:** Bolts engage rounds in the main cam path.
2. **Chambering:** Rounds chambered as the bolts move forward in the firing cam path.
3. **Locking and Firing:** Bolt locks into place, firing voltage applied.
4. **Extraction:**  Bolt unlocks and extracts the fired round. 
5. **Ejection:**  Spent round ejected into the unload drive assembly.

#### Clearing Cycle

##### Trigger Release

1. **Voltage Maintenance:** Round fire and counting voltage remain active until hydraulic braking slows the gun.
2. **Delayed Shut Off:**  5-11 rounds may fire after trigger release.
3. **Bolt Lock:**  All six bolts lock in the cleared position when the gun decelerates through 3,900 ± 150 RPM. 
4. **Live Round Return:**  6-9 live rounds clear the gun and return to the ammunition container.
5. **Total Stop Time:** Slightly under 1 second.

### Gun Preflight

#### Control and Safing

##### Rounds Limit Switch, Limit Counter, and Totalizer

* **Location:** Bottom of the ammunition container.
* **Functions:**
    * Safing
    * Limiting the number of rounds processed.

[Figure D-6: Gun Control and Load]

* **Totalizer (1):**  Records the total number of rounds fired over the system's lifespan.

##### Rounds Limit Switch (3)

* **RDS LIMIT Setting (Limit Count ≤ 799):**  Controls rounds fired per sortie.
* **Clearing Cycle Initiation:** Triggered when the preset round count is reached.
* **Overshoot:**  Up to 20 additional rounds may be fired at full rate.
* **Hydraulic Safing:**  Gun is hydraulically safe after limiter shutdown (limit count in the 979-999 range).
* **HUD Rounds Count:**  Displays "XXX" to indicate limit/total rounds expended.
* **RDS LIMIT (Limit Count 800-999):** Gun is hydraulically safe. 
* **NO LIMIT Setting:** Only the armament ground safety pin and cam holdback tool/download pin prevent firing when the trigger is pulled. 

##### Hydraulic Manual Control Handle (4)

* **Stowed Position (Flush):** Indicates the gun is not in load mode and is ready for firing.

##### Type Ammo (5)

* **Verification:**  Observe at the load gate and compare to AFTO Form 781A (refer to AFTO Form 781H for the correct page/block).

##### Load Gate Tangs/Cartridge Guide Tangs (6)

* **Proper Positioning:**  Essential for ammo feeding.
* **Separation:**  Occurs during loading.
* **Post-Load:**  Positioned tips-to-tips to provide a smooth ammo path.

#### PACS Programming

##### Ammo Type and Quantity (Figure D-8)

* **Programming:**  The A/A weapon load page allows for selecting both bullet type and quantity.

[Figure D-8: Load]

* **Quantity:**  Loaded using PB #1 and #2.
* **Bullet Type:** 
    * Displayed under PB #20 (PGU-28 or M-56).
    * Toggle selection with PB #20. 
    * Can also be set at the AFMSS (Air Force Mission Support System) and entered via DTM (Data Transfer Module). 

* **Counters:** Displayed values on the PACS and HUD are for informational purposes only and don't affect gun arming/dearming.

**Note:** Incorrect programming can cause significant errors in gunsight calculations.

##### Rounds Remaining Display (Figure D-9)

* **Format:**  Round count followed by a "P" for PGU-28 or "M" for M-56 (except on the HUD, where type is not indicated).

[Figure D-9: Round Count Displayed]

* **Training Mode:**  The last digit in the PACS and HUD bullet count is replaced by a "T" when A/A TRNG is selected. 

### Gunsight Modes

#### Modes

* **Gun Director Sight (GDS):**  Accurate, all-aspect gunsight.
* **Funnel (FNL):** Backup gunsight, allows for target range estimation by comparing wingspan to funnel width (accurate within certain limitations).

**Note:**

* **Radar Tracking:**  Radar in single target track (STT).
* **Gun Tracking:**  Pilot tracks the target using HUD aiming symbology.

#### GDS Mode

##### Functionality

* **Accurate Aiming:** Eliminates the need for steady-state tracking. 
* **Reticle Display:**  Appears after:
    * Final radar track with JEM (Jet Engine Modulation) resolved.
    * 1.5 second settling time delay.
    * Valid data for computation. 

* **Computations:** CC (Central Computer) factors in:
    * Target velocities and accelerations.
    * Estimated future target position.
    * Bullet trajectory and target dynamics.

##### Advantages

* **Eliminates Lead Anticipation:** No need to fire early to compensate for bullet TOF (Time of Flight). 
* **No Steady-State Tracking Required:**  Accurate reticle aiming even without a stable pipper on target. However, higher hit probability is achieved with a shorter TOF and low target LOS (Line of Sight) rates. 

##### Director Mode Software (GDS Algorithm)

* **Lead Angle Computation:** Uses radar data and is independent of F-15E maneuvering/accelerations, allowing for rapid aiming and minimal impact from attitude changes.

##### Reticle Motion

* **Undampened:** Reticle motion reflects actual bullet stream dynamics.
* **Stiffen Selection (GDS or GDS Funnel):**
    * Reverts to LCOS track funnel display with the LCOS reticle positioned at radar target range. 
    * Uses 1,000 feet for range and/or -50 FPS for range rate if those values are unavailable.

#### Funnel (FNL) Mode

##### Assumptions

* F-15E can out-turn opponents and establish a tracking position. 
* F-15E is in the target's plane of motion (POM) with ≤ 45° angle-off.
* F-15E and target are pulling the same G-load.

##### Functionality

* **Lead Computing Optical Sight (LCOS) Algorithm:** Used for calculations, relying primarily on ownship data (except for radar range/range rate when available).
* **Dynamic Response:** Funnel reacts to changes in F-15E acceleration. 
* **Accuracy:** Dependent on the availability and quality of radar data.

##### Funnel Display

* **Center:**  Corresponds to pseudo LCOS reticles.
* **Width:** Represents a 40-foot wingspan target at seven computed ranges (750, 1,000, 1,250, 1,500, 2,250, 4,000, and 5,000 feet).
* **End Limit:**  Limited to bullet maximum range when less than 5,000 feet.
* **No Radar Track:** Three 2-mil pippers are displayed at 1,000, 2,250, and 4,000 feet (PGU-28) or at 1,000 and 2,250 feet (M56).

##### Aiming with the Funnel

* **Pilot's Task:** Maneuver the target within the funnel at the correct range for a firing solution. 
* **Range Estimation:** Use the funnel width (representing a 40-foot wingspan) to estimate target range. 
* **Usage:** 
    * **Tracking Reference:** Stabilize the appropriate section of the funnel on the target and fire (maintain constant G for a stable sight picture). 
    * **Dampened Bullet Position Indicator:**  
        * Fly to create a common intercept point between the target and funnel (at the correct range).
        * Fire when the funnel center is approximately one TOF plus gun spin-up time from the intercept.

### HUD Gunsight Displays

#### Display Options

* LCOS Search Funnel
* LCOS Track Funnel
* GDS
* GDS Funnel

**Selection Factors:** Radar track status, funnel selection, combined mode status.

#### Gunsight Display Selection (Figure D-10)

[Figure D-10: Gunsight Display Selection]

##### LCOS Search Funnel (Figure D-11)

* **Conditions:** GUN selected, radar in search mode. 
* **Only No-Lock Gun Display:**  Provides aiming assistance without radar lock-on. 
* **Funnel Representation:** Simulated bullet stream emanating from the F-15E (dynamically adjusts during maneuvering). 
* **Top of Funnel:** Closer ranges. 
* **Bottom of Funnel:** Maximum ranges.

##### Pippers and RATR

* **Pippers:** Three 2-mil circles at 1,000, 2,250, and 4,000 feet aiming ranges.
* **Funnel Width:** Based on the apparent size of a 40-foot wingspan target at the corresponding range.
* **Tracking Solution:** Place a pipper on the target, visually confirm the range, and fire.
* **RATR (Rounds At Target Range) Cue:** 
    * Inverted triangle showing where bullets will impact at a pseudo target range of 2,250 feet (1,000 feet if stiffened). 
    * With radar lock-on: Indicates bullet impact location at radar-derived target range. 
    * Displayed from first bullet arrival until the last bullet in the burst. 
    * Not HUD-limited (won't be displayed if computed position is outside the FOV).

##### Rounds Remaining Display

* **Indication:** Approximate number of rounds loaded and not yet fired.
* **Decrement:** Decreases by 10 during firing. 

##### LCOS Track Funnel (Figure D-12)

* **Conditions:** GUN selected, radar has achieved lock-on. 
* **Display Duration:** Until stable radar STT (Single Target Track) is achieved, after which the GDS or GDS FNL display is shown (based on the last selection).

##### Reticle and Funnel Movement

* **Reticle:** 2-mil pipper and 25-mil segmented circle.
* **Positioning:** Based on radar target range/range rate and ownship maneuvering parameters. Uses 2,250 feet for range (or 1,000 feet if stiffened) and 50 FPS for range rate if those values are invalid.

##### Tracking Solution

Hold the pipper on the target in a stable tracking situation and fire (bullets should impact after one TOF). 

##### Range Bar

* **Analog "Clock" Format:** Shows radar-derived range.
* **Movement:** Starts at 12 o'clock and moves clockwise.
* **Range Reading:** Leading edge indicates range in thousands of feet. 

##### GDS (Figure D-13)

* **Conditions:** GUN selected (or combined mode), full radar lock-on.
* **Toggling:** Use the FCP coolie switch to switch between GDS and GDS FNL displays.
* **"GDS" Display:**  Appears in HUD window 17. 
* **Aiming:** Place the pipper on the target and fire (assuming within effective range). 

##### Turn Plane Line

* **Function:**  Represents the CC's projection of the target's POM (Plane of Motion). Aids in achieving an in-plane solution during high-aspect gun attacks.
* **Display:**  Line drawn from the gun cross, through the reticle, to the HUD edge.

##### Range Bar and BMR

* **Range Bar:** Functions as previously described.
* **BMR (Bullet Maximum Range) Cue:** 
    * Dynamically positioned dot on the 50-mil reticle perimeter.
    * Indicates maximum effective range based on loaded round type and ownship/target maneuvering/relationship.
    * Range reading: Same as range bar. 
    * If exceeding 12,000 feet: Limited to the 12 o'clock position.

* **Maximum Accurate Firing Range:** Achieved when the range bar tab aligns with the BMR cue or is shorter. 

##### TD Box Removal/Reappearance

* **Removed:** When its center is within 25 mils of the pipper and the target range is less than 3,000 feet (or the maximum bullet range, whichever is greater). 
* **Reappears:** When the range increases to 3,200 feet (or 200 feet beyond the maximum bullet range), or when the box center is more than 37 mils from the pipper. 

##### GDS Funnel (Figure D-14)

* **Conditions:**  GUN mode, radar has achieved single target track. 
* **Display:** Combines GDS reticle and LCOS track funnel displays (turn plane line is replaced by the funnel). 
* **"FNL" Display:**  Appears in HUD window 17 when GDS Funnel is active. 
* **Dual Solutions:** Provides two aiming solutions (GDS and LCOS).

### Gun Employment

#### Firing Rate

* **HIGH:**  Greater bullet stream density and higher Pk (probability of kill). Provides approximately 5 seconds of continuous fire at 100 rounds per second.
* **A/A Combat:** Fire in 1-2 second bursts to increase bullet density near the target.

#### Trigger Release Delay

Remember the ~1 second delay between trigger release and gun stoppage (clearing cycle). Avoid pulling the trigger again during this period. 

#### Long Range Shot Considerations

* **Increased TOF:**  Gives the target more time to maneuver and avoid the bullet stream. 
* **Error Potential:**  Avoid firing at near-maximum range.

#### PGU-28 Advantages

* **Increased Effective Range:**  Due to higher muzzle velocity and lower drag.
* **Reduced Lead Requirement:**  Compared to the M-56. 

### Gun Tracking Shots

#### LCOS Search Display (Figure D-15)

* **Conditions:** No radar lock-on. 
* **Range Estimation:**  Crucial. Use funnel width (representing a 40-foot wingspan) as a guide. 
* **Target Placement:**  Position the target within the funnel where its wingspan matches the funnel width for a good firing solution (adjust aiming based on actual wingspan).

##### Shot Approach Options

* Pull the target down through the funnel until a wingspan match is achieved. 
* Position your nose ahead of the target and guide them into position from the bottom of the funnel. 

**Firing Timing:** Initiate one TOF before the funnel/wingspan match, especially if the target is not in a stable tracking position. 

#### LCOS Track Display (Figure D-16)

* **Conditions:** Radar lock-on.
* **Effective Envelope:** 
    * Aspect ≤ 45°.
    * Closure ≤ 30 knots.
    * In target POM.
    * Constant G-load.

* **Aiming:** Track the target with the pipper (wingspan/funnel matching not required).

#### Pipper Considerations

* **Accuracy:**  Pipper on target doesn't guarantee bullet impact, especially in high aspect/closure situations where the sight may under-lead. 
* **Out-of-Plane Target:** The pipper will lag until shooter parameters stabilize. 
* **Increasing G:**  Can depress the pipper and indicate a need for more lead. Avoid adding G and firing simultaneously (results in bullets trailing the target).

#### GDS Display (Figure D-17)

* **Aiming:**  Place the pipper on the target and fire (within BMR range). 
* **Tracking Time:**  Extended tracking is not required. 

#### GDS FNL Display (Figure D-18)

* **Aiming:** Place the pipper on the target and fire (within BMR range). 
* **Funnel:**  Aids in shot alignment. 
* **Tracking Time:**  Extended tracking not required.

#### GDS and GDS FNL: Tracking vs. Snapshot

##### Considerations

* Energy state
* Threat environment
* Maneuvering requirements
* Timing

##### Tracking Shots

* **Advantages:** High Pk.
* **Disadvantages:** Time-consuming, energy-intensive, predictable F-15E flight path. 

##### Snapshot

* **Advantages:** Conserves energy, allows for quick separation if unsuccessful. 
* **Disadvantage:**  Lower Pk. 

#### GDS/GDS FNL Tracking Shot

1. **Initialization:** Wait ~1.5 seconds after radar lock-on for GDS initialization (LCOS track display will be shown during this period). 
2. **Lead:** Pull sufficient lead (reticle ahead of target) and use the turn plane line/funnel to establish an in-plane solution. 
3. **Controlled Rate:** Allow the pipper to move towards the target at a manageable rate.
4. **Fire:** When within range, keeping the pipper on the target as needed. 
5. **RATR Confirmation:**  Should appear over the target one TOF after trigger pull.

#### GDS/GDS FNL Snapshot

1. **Lead Establishment:** 
    * More lead brings the target closer at firing range and reduces TOF, but can obscure over-the-nose visibility.
    * A slight out-of-plane pursuit course is acceptable for maintaining visual contact.
    * Use the turn plane line/funnel to guide both in-plane and slightly out-of-plane maneuvers. 
2. **POM Alignment:**  Reposition into the target's POM as range decreases and the target tracks forward.
3. **Firing Decision:**
    * **Advantage:** Direct indication of bullet miss distance (no dampening or maneuver-induced delays). 
    * **Lag:** 
        * None due to fighter maneuvering. 
        * Up to 2 seconds due to target jinking (caused by radar tracking filter lag). 

#### LCOS Search/Track Funnel Snapshot

* **Firing Point:** Determined by the track rate of the funnel match/pipper and the target towards each other.
* **Stable Parameters:**  Fire one TOF before the pipper/target intercept.
* **Increased G (LOS Rate Adjustment):** The pipper will depress towards the target and be out of solution. Open fire earlier to compensate. Cease fire once the pipper passes through the target (avoid wasting ammo and delaying repositioning/separation). 

[Figure D-19: Snap Shot]

### Shot Criteria

Refer to Table D-1 for current F-15 gun shot criteria (AFTTP 3-1, Volume 1, Change 1, 17 Mar 98). 

[Table D-1: Gun Shot Criteria]

#### Gun Shot Assessment

##### Conversion Methodology

The following explanation details how the Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manual (JMEM) 20-round requirement translates into RATR (Rounds at Target Range) frame counts for both 3/4-inch and 8mm VTR (Video Tape Recorder).

##### Assumptions

* **Bullet Dispersion:**  The F-15 gun has ≤ 4 mils of dispersion (80% of bullets within a 4-foot cone at 1,000 feet). 
* **Published Dispersion:** 8 mils (accounts for boresight error, radar track latency, scintillation, other aircraft factors).
* **Valid RATR Frame:** Any frame where the center of the RATR touches the aircraft (up to 50% of the RATR can be off the aircraft at any given time).
* **Average Hit Percentage:** ~40%.

##### 3/4-inch VTR and 8mm Assessment

To achieve a JMEM-compliant 20-round hit:

* **Required Time on Target:** 0.75 seconds. 
* **Frame Counts:**
    * 3/4-inch VTR (60 FPS): 30 frames.
    * 8mm (30 FPS): 15 frames. 

* **Full RATR on Target:**  Reduces required frames due to higher hit probability (15 frames for 3/4-inch VTR, 8 frames for 8mm).
* **Two-Frame Count:** Any frame where the entire RATR is on the target and its center is on the fuselage counts as two frames. This acknowledges the increased hit probability, ensures bullet density on vital aircraft components, and factors in the improved survivability of 4th generation aircraft to PGU rounds hitting the wings. 

##### Shot Definitions

* **Gun Attempt:** Any trigger pull. 
* **Valid Gun Shot:** Any attempt resulting in at least one frame with the RATR center on the target.
* **Invalid Gun Shot:** Any attempt resulting in no frames with the RATR center on target due to shooter error (plane, range, lead, etc.).
* **Defeated Gun Shot:**  Any attempt resulting in no frames with the RATR center on target due to successful target evasion (jinking, out-of-plane maneuvers, etc.).

### Failures

#### Double Generator/Utility B Failure

Electrical and hydraulic power loss disables the gun.

#### ADC/INS Failure

* **Reversion:** Gunsight reverts to FNL backup mode.
* **Complete INS Failure:**  Results in a fixed, depressed gunsight. Enter the desired mil depression angle in the UFC.

#### PACS Failure

* **Gun Function:** An armed gun will fire.
* **Limitations:** 
    * Unable to change firing rate or monitor/adjust rounds count.
    * No gun reticles on the HUD. 

#### CC Failure

* **Gun Cross:** Continuously displayed (if master arm is in ARM).
* **Aiming:** Gun cross becomes the sole reference (Figure D-20). 

[Figure D-20: Gun CC Failure]

### Combined Mode

#### Functionality

* Allows simultaneous use of the gunsight and gun while SRM (Short Range Missile) is selected. 
* Radar display behaves as if in SRM mode. 
* Gun mode symbology takes priority on the HUD, with limited SRM data added.
* HUD reverts to primary gun mode upon firing. 

#### Combined Mode Entry

1. Select SRM on the weapon select switch. 
2. Pull up on the FCP coolie switch for more than 1 second. 

**Preconditions:**

* A/A master mode selected.
* Pilot in command of the A/A radar.
* SRM selected.
* Any radar mode except TWS (Track-While-Scan). 
* Gun rounds available. 

**TWS Exclusion:** Prevents conflict with the coolie switch function. 

**SRM Availability:**  Not required for combined mode entry. 

**GDS/GDS FNL Toggling:**  Activate the coolie switch up for less than 1 second while in combined mode.

#### Combined Mode Exit

Triggered by:

* Holding the coolie switch up for longer than 1 second.

[Figure D-21: Combined, STT, Stiffen LCOS Selected, Boresight SRM]

#### AIM-9M HUD Displays (Combined Mode)

* **Seeker Circle:** Present, but FOV circle is not displayed (no indication of SCAN mode).
* **Radar Search:** Seeker circle is at the boresight position (Figure D-22).

[Figure D-22: Combined, Radar in Search]

##### Uncaged Seeker Circle

* **SBR (Special Burst Ranging):**  Commanded when the seeker is uncaged. 
* **Data Display (Figure D-23):**
    * Range scale
    * Target range caret
    * Vc (closure velocity) 

* **Data Duration:** 3 seconds.
* **Additional SBRs:** Triggered by pressing the laser fire button (FCP).
* **Not Displayed During SBR:** Rmax (LC/HC), Rmin (LC/HC), and the shoot cue.

[Figure D-23: Radar in Search, Uncaged SRM, SBR]

##### Radar Lock-On

* **Display (Figure D-24):** 
    * Rmax (LC/HC) and Rmin (LC/HC) displayed when AIM-9M and radar LOS are within 2°. 
    * Shoot cue displayed (and flashing) if within launch parameters. 
    * TD box displayed.

[Figure D-24: AIM-9M Shoot Cue]

##### TD Box Occlusion (Figure D-25)

* **Condition:**  TD box is removed due to close proximity to the gunsight.
* **Shoot Cue:** Displayed flashing at the top or bottom of the seeker position circle when the TD box is hidden.

[Figure D-25: STT, Uncaged SRM, TD Box Occluded]

##### Off-Missile Cue

* **Radar STT:** Replaces round count (Figure D-26). 
* **Gun Firing:** Round count replaces the off-missile cue until the trigger is released.

[Figure D-26: STT, Off-Missile, Uncaged SRM, Shoot Cue]

##### Inside Rmin LC

* **No Break X:** The break X symbol is not displayed when the target is within Rmin LC (minimum range, low confidence).
* **SRM Symbology:** Remains, but the shoot cue, SRM count, and type are removed. 
* **No Zone Cue:** Also not displayed (Figure D-27).

[Figure D-27: STT, Inside SRM Minimum Range, Caged SRM, GDS]

#### Gun HUD Displays (Combined Mode)

* **Full Functionality:** All normal gun mode displays are available. 
* **SBR:**  The LCOS search funnel is displayed, but SBR data is not used for gunsight computations.

#### Trigger Activation (Combined Mode)

* **Removed:** SRM shoot cue and AIM-9M seeker head position circle (Figure D-28).
* **Displayed:**  Rmax (LC/HC), Rmin (LC/HC), SRM count, rounds remaining (replaces off-missile cue if applicable). 
* **Priority:**  Gunsight symbology until trigger release or all rounds are expended. 
* **RATR:**  Appears after one TOF if within the HUD FOV. 

[Figure D-28: STT, Trigger Activated]

##### Trigger Release

* **Restored:**  SRM symbology (except for the shoot cue). 
* **Shoot Cue Reappearance:** After the last bullet's TOF is complete and the RATR is removed.
* **Last Round Fired:** Combined mode automatically exits to SRM after the last round's TOF and RATR removal. 

#### A/A Radar Display (Combined Mode)

* **Display Elements:** Shoot cue, Rmax (LC/HC), and Rmin (LC/HC) are displayed under the same conditions as on the HUD.

#### HUD Window 5 (Combined Mode)

Table D-2 details the HUD window 5 displays for combined/SRM/GUN operation.
