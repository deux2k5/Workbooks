JFS Generator

The JFS generator provides power for:

JFS ignition and control

Intercom system (cockpit & ground crew chief)
Front cockpit utility light

AMAD fire warning/extinguisher system

JFS ready light

The JFS READY light (Figure D-4) tells you when the JFS is up to speed
and the intercom, utility light, and AMAD fire warning are available.

Emergency Generator

Emergency AC/DC power is available through the emergency generator,
driven by the utility hydraulic system (Figure D-5). The emergency
generator is separate from the primary system and provides electrical
power during electrical system failure and initial engine start.

ACG-04-05

Figure D - 5. Emergency Generator.

The emergency generator is a critical backup system. When you are ready
to start, hack the clock and raise the right finger lift to start the right
engine.

When the engine reaches 15-17%, enough hydraulic pressure is present to

start the emergency generator. This should occur within 30 seconds
(maximum) after raising the finger lift.

D-5 ACG-4


Text from ACG-4_Electrical_System_page_12.jpeg:
During a normal start, you can verify that the emergency generator comes
on-line. Note in Figure D-6 that the top two lines (RPM and FTIT) are
powered by the emergency generator and register on the engine monitor
display (EMD).

Figure D - 6. Engine Monitor Display.

If the engine is rotating and the top two lines of the EMD fail to register
readings, it is possible (but unlikely) that the EMD, rather than the
emergency generator, has failed. An easy way to troubleshoot is to test
the engine fire lights. If they test good, the problem is the EMD. If they
test bad, the problem is the emergency generator.

ACG-4 D-6


Text from ACG-4_Electrical_System_page_13.jpeg:
If the emergency generator does not come on-line, cycle the emergency
generator switch through ISOLATE. If that does not solve the problem,
position the engine master switches and JF'S switch to OFF and abort the

mission.

When the right main generator comes on-line (about 56% rpm), the EMER
BST ON and L GEN cautions illuminate to show that both emergency
generator and emergency boost pump are operating properly (Figure D-7).
(Other cautions—such as ENGINE, FLT CONTR, HYD, etc.—illuminate

also.)

During normal start, 30 seconds after the main generator comes on-line,
the emergency generator shuts off to avoid needless operation. The only
indication of this is the BST SYS MAL caution light (Figure D-8). It
comes on in addition to the EMER BST ON caution to show that the
emergency fuel boost pump is now operating from an abnormal power
source—a main generator.

Figure D - 8. Caution Lights Panel.

If the BST SYS MAL caution illuminates less than 30 seconds after the
first main generator comes on-line, the emergency generator has dropped
off-line prematurely. (If rpm and FTIT go blank before the BST SYS MAL
caution illuminates, this is also an indication of premature cutoff.)
Position the throttles and engine master switches to OFF and have
maintenance investigate.

When the second main generator comes on-line, the EMER BST ON and
BST SYS MAL cautions go out along with the L GEN, ENGINE, and HYD
caution lights.

ACG-4 D-8


Text from ACG-4_Electrical_System_page_15.jpeg:
NOTE

The FLT CONTR light will be on because the CAS switches have not been
reset (yaw CAS, roll CAS, pitch CAS, HIGH AOA DEGRADE cautions
also illuminate). The AV BIT light is usually on (unless an aircrew
member has pressed a master caution light) because most systems are
turned off.

AC Generators

The two main AC generators are mounted on the right and left AMADs. A
constant speed drive (CSD) maintains frequency control throughout the
entire rpm range of the engines. When both generators are operating,
each independently supplies power to certain aircraft AC buses

(Figure D-9). If either generator should fail, the other provides necessary
power via a crossover system.

Current Limiters

Each generator circuit is also protected by a current limiter (a slow-blow
type fuse that cannot be reset). It prevents a fault in one generator from
damaging the other generator, which causes both generators to be shut
down. It also prevents overloads on the remaining generator during
single generator operation. If a current limiter (i.e., current limited fuse)
blows, the associated crossover circuit is broken. The generator control
unit (GCU) logic assumes that improper current fed from that generator
caused the current limiter to blow. It then takes that generator off-line to
prevent further damage. Therefore, power is removed from the associated
bus. However, if the other generator is on-line, it transfers current via the
remaining crossover circuit, and powers both buses. The GCU continues
to monitor current output from the off-line generator. When that current
is within standards again, the generator can be reset (placed back on-line)
to power its own bus.

Generator Control Switch

The L and R GEN control switches are two position (OFF and ON)
lever-lock type switches (Figure D-10). They must be raised before being
moved to a new position. You may disconnect a generator from its buses
(place it off-line) at any time by positioning its switch to OFF.

Figure D - 11. Electrical System.

The GCU disconnects the generator from its buses if a fault occurs, then
transfers the electrical load to the other main generator. When this
occurs, the master caution and L GEN or R GEN caution lights come on
and you may notice a momentary interruption of power. When a
generator caution light flashes, the GCU has identified an under
frequency condition and is trying to reset the generator automatically.

The generator control switch must be cycled OFF/ON to reset the
generator after most faults (except under frequency) occur.

D-11 ACG-4


Text from ACG-4_Electrical_System_page_18.jpeg:
DC Power

TRs convert AC power from the main generators to DC power for the DC
buses. The left and right TRs have a protection system (TRCU) similar to
the AC system. If the system isolates a faulty TR, the remaining TR
powers the entire DC system. A third TR (the essential TR) operates
independently of the other TRs.

No cockpit warning of a single TR failure is provided. The emergency

generator only activates when both main TRs fail. TR failure is covered in
the emergency operations section of this text.

ANSWERS

1. a. Main generator: The two main generators supply AC electrical
power to the aircraft.

b. GCU: The GCU protects the generator against damage due to
voltage, frequency, and mechanical failure. It disconnects the
generator from its buses if a fault occurs. At the same time, it
transfers the electrical load to the other main generator’s bus.

c. TR: TRs are used to convert AC to DC. There are three of them.
Two power the left and right DC buses. One powers the
essential TR DC bus.

d. Emergency generator: Supplies emergency AC/DC power in the
aircraft. It can power all systems necessary for a safe recovery.

e. Bussystem: The bus system distributes power to the aircraft
electrical systems.

f. Current limiter: A current limiter prevents a fault in one
generator from causing both generators to be shut down or
damaged.

g. JFS generator: Provides JFS ignition and control, AMAD fire
detection/extinguisher during start, FCP utility light and
intercom system until the main generator comes on-line.

2. See note 2 on page FO-13. The armament bus is energized with the
landing gear handle up. If the landing gear handle is in the down
position, the armament bus can be energized by placing the
armament safety override switch to the OVERRIDE position.

3. a. Generator control switch: Connects/removes a generator to/from
its buses.

ACG-4 D-16


Text from ACG-4_Electrical_System_page_23.jpeg:
10.

11.

12.

b. Emergency generator switch: Controls emergency generator. If
placed in the AUTO position, the emergency generator will be
automatically activated if either/both main generators are
inoperative, both left and right TRs fail, or if either/both main
fuel boost pumps fail. The MAN position provides manual
activation of the emergency generator. The ISOLATE position
restricts the emergency generator to powering the emergency
fuel boost pump, arresting hook, and emergency air refueling
switch.

Test the AMAD fire light. If it tests OK, have the crew chief replace
the JFS light.

Situation A: (Questions 7-9) You are starting an F-15E (no external
power connected). With the JFS running, you raise the finger lift and
the whine of the JFS tells you that the JFS has engaged the engine
and operation is normal. You feel the engine rpm increase, but 30
seconds later you have no rpm indications on the EMD.

The emergency generator did not come on-line.

You should try to bring the emergency generator on-line by cycling
the emergency generator switch to ISOLATE and then back to the
AUTO position.

Position the engine master switches to OFF, JFS to OFF, and abort.
Situation B: (Questions 10-12) While starting the right engine, you
note that the rpm and FTIT indications are normal. The EMER BST
ON caution appears (i.e., R main generator comes on-line). Fifteen

seconds later the BST SYS MAL caution appears.

The BST SYS MAL caution illuminated prematurely (30 seconds has
not elapsed).

The emergency generator failed and dropped off-line prematurely.

Position the throttles OFF, the engine master switches off, and have
maintenance investigate the malfunction.

External Power

External power may be connected to the aircraft through an external
electrical receptacle near the nose gear wheelwell (Figure D-12). External
power is used mainly by the ground crew during repair and maintenance.
On rare occasions, you may be requested to do an external power start.
Follow your checklist.

EXTERNAL POWER

Figure D - 12. External Power.

The aircraft buses are energized by external power in a manner similar to
an operating main generator. Exceptions are those buses which furnish
power to systems that do not have on/off control switches and/or require
cooling air. Power can be applied to these buses by using ground power
switches (covered later in this section).

If you are on external power and start the left engine first, the complete
electrical system automatically switches to internal power when the left
generator comes on-line.

ACG-4 D-18


Text from ACG-4_Electrical_System_page_25.jpeg:
If the right engine is started first, however, the right generator powers
only the buses it normally feeds. The buses usually fed by the left
generator remain on external power (except those supported by the JFS
generator) until external power is removed or the left engine is started
and the left generator comes on-line.

External Power Control Switch

The three position external power control switch, located on the engine
control panel (Figure D-13), controls application of external power to the
aircraft electrical buses. An external power monitor prevents faulty
external power from being connected to the aircraft.

Ground Power Control Panel/Switches

Seven ground power switches are located on the ground power control
panel (Figure D-14). These switches are primarily used by maintenance
to power up systems that require cooling air. Be sure they are in AUTO.
Placing these switches to ON allows external power to be connected to the
avionics group associated with the individual switch. The switches are
electrically held on and will revert to auto if internal power is available or
external ground power is disconnected. OFF prevents any power from
being applied to the respective avionics group(s).

console in each cockpit. It has an alligator clip and an integral ON
(variable brightness) and OFF switch (Figure D-24). The utility light in
the front cockpit is the only lighting available with JFS generator power.

NOTE

The JFS cannot be started with both engines running. So, carry a
flashlight in of total electrical failure!

ANSWERS

1. a. External power control switch - Controls the application of
external power to the aircraft electrical buses. In NORM
position, aircraft electrical buses can be energized by external
power if no aircraft generators are running. RESET will
establish external power if it is not on the line. (RESET is
spring-loaded to NORM.) OFF disconnects external power from
the aircraft.

b. Ground power control panel switches - Maintenance uses these
switches to power up systems that require cooling air. Check to
be sure they are in AUTO position.

EMERGENCY OPERATIONS

This section deals with electrical system operation and corrective action
necessary in the following emergencies:

Emergency generator operation/failure
Main generator failure

Transformer rectifier(s) failure

Complete electrical system failure

Smoke, fumes, or fire in cockpit (electrical)

AMAD failure

Emergency Generator Operation/Failure

System features: The emergency generator supplies power to the
essential AC/DC buses, the emergency/essential buses, and ground power
switch number 1 (28 volt DC bus for operation of the engine monitor
display). The emergency generator automatically comes on-line when:

Either or both main generators fail,
Both left and right TRs fail,
Either or both main boost pumps fail (or pressure is low),

Or some combination of these faults occur.

D - 37 ACG-4


Text from ACG-4_Electrical_System_page_44.jpeg:
The emergency generator control switch is located at the top center of the
engine control panel (Figure D-27). It is a three-position toggle switch
with positions of AUTO, MAN, and ISOLATE. The switch is electrically
held in ISOLATE when positioned there.

AUTO provides automatic activation of the emergency generator. In this
position, after an internal power ground start, the emergency generator
will shut down 30 seconds after the first main generator comes on-line.
(For all starts with external power the emergency generator will not
operate while external power is connected.)

MAN provides manual activation of the emergency generator and connects
it to its buses.

ISOLATE restricts the emergency generator. It supplies power to the
emergency fuel boost pump, the EMER BST ON caution light, arresting
hook, the emergency/essential 28 volt DC bus (for the emergency air
refueling switch to open the slipway door) and ground power switch
number 1 (28 volt DC bus for operation of the engine monitor display
[EMD)]) (top two lines only).

NOTE

MSOGS and cockpit intercom are not available in ISOLATE.

The emergency generator should automatically come on-line. You should
also see the EMER BST ON caution. This tells you that the emergency
generator is operating and powering the emergency boost pump.

If the emergency generator fails to come on-line, you will see BST SYS
MAL in addition to L or R GEN. (This failure is remote since you verified

the emergency generator was working during start.)

NOTE

A generator must be recycled to reset over/under voltage, over frequency,
feeder faults or generator locked rotor after the fault clears in order to put
the generator back on-line.

D-41 ACG-4


Text from ACG-4_Electrical_System_page_48.jpeg:
Actions for single generator failure:

e Check that the L/R GEN caution is not caused by an AMAD failure or
engine problem (e.g., a stall/stagnation or flameout).

e Cycle the failed generator’s switch to OFF and back ON - once.
e RESTORED? - Leave it alone and write it up later.

e FAIL TO RESTORE? - Turn the switch OFF and return to base.
e CAUTION - Be sure that you cycle the CORRECT SWITCH!

Double Generator Failure

A double generator failure is indicated by:

e All MPDs and rear cockpit MPCDs go blank. The front cockpit
MPCD displays an ADI and indicates the cautions.

e = Loss of normal cockpit lighting.

e Both L GEN and R GEN cautions light (along with the master
caution).

e Emergency generator and emergency boost pump activate (EMER
BST ON caution).

e HYD caution lights (warning systems lose power source).
e Landing gear warning is displayed (air data computer is out).

e Loss of power to the instruments and equipment listed as inoperative
in the Dash 1 and/or in the checklist.

NOTE: In the event of a double generator failure, the inertial navigation
system (INS) is backed up by the emergency generator, through the
essential AC bus. The crew would have INS for navigation and IFF and
UHF #1 available for a GCA recovery. (ILS and TACAN are inoperative.)
The attitude heading reference system (AHRS) works off the left 115V AC
bus, so it would not be available. Under TCTO 1F-15E-737, the EGI
(embedded GPS/INS) replaces the AHRS and the exact wiring is not yet
known.

While many other cautions are also on, you are interested in knowing if
the emergency generator is working. Check EMER BST ON caution
(Figure D-31).

The emergency generator can provide enough power to get you home after
a dual generator failure. It automatically powers the essential buses IF
you left the emergency generator switch in AUTO or MAN.

Actions for double generator failure:

e Maintain control of the aircraft.

e Verify that the emergency generator is working. Check EMER BST

Text from ACG-4_Electrical_System_page_50.jpeg:
Critical equipment and instruments - The Dash 1 and checklist provide
some vital information for you. Get to know the equipment and
instruments that will and will not work during a double generator failure.
Even if you can look it up while in the air, the situation may call for faster
action. Plan for those situations now.

Follow the double boost pump failure procedure. You can navigate using
INS but you will not have TACAN available. Since ILS is inoperative, you
must fly a visual approach or a GCA on the EADI and standby
instruments using UHF #1. If your emergency generator fails, you must
be prepared to perform the total boost pump failure procedure.

Transformer Rectifier Failure

If either left or right TR fails, the other TR powers the entire DC system.
The failure of both left and right TRs automatically activates the
emergency generator if the emergency generator switch is in AUTO.

Remember, you have no cockpit indication of a single TR failure;
therefore, it is possible to accept an aircraft with only one operational left
or right TR. Test switches for the TRs are located in the electronic bays
and are checked by maintenance.

The failure of both left and right TRs result in loss of the left and right 28
volt DC buses. Flight capabilities may be degraded by the loss of the
equipment powered by these buses (Ref. TO 1F-15E-1, pages FO-13 and
15). The most noticeable equipment lost would include:

Right 28V DC bus Right boost pump relay (lose pump)
HYD pressure indication
XFER pump indication
Aft left and right MPCD
Right air inlet control
Armament bus
LANTIRN NAV/TGT POD

Left 28V DC bus Left boost pump relay (lose pump)

Complete Electrical System Failure
Certain manual systems are available without electrical power.
Remember, there is no battery in this aircraft.

With no electrical power available (AC or DC), you lose the use of all fuel
boost pumps and the arresting hook.

But even then, the aircraft can be recovered.

The following systems are still available:

e = =Flight controls (manual)

e =6 Engine ignition

e §=6© Gravity fuel feed

e Emergency landing gear extension

e Emergency nosewheel steering and brakes

e  =Brakes (no antiskid protection)

e Standby airspeed, heading, and altimeter (ADI for 9 minutes)

With the limited equipment available, remain VFR and land as soon as
possible.

Text from ACG-4_Electrical_System_page_52.jpeg:
Smoke, Fumes, or Fire in the Cockpit

Equipment in the cockpit uses low current levels, so wiring insulation may
smolder, but there is little chance of a serious fire. Also, there are no fuel
or hydraulic lines passing through or near the cockpit area.

Smoke, fumes, or fire in the cockpit indications:

The indications are self-explanatory; however, some general guidance is in
order:

e Consider all unidentified odors as toxic.

e Do not confuse condensation from the air conditioning system as
smoke.

e Acharacteristic of the F-15E is emission of a pungent blue-gray
smoke from the air or defog outlets during engine run-up and takeoff
roll. It is something you learn to recognize.

Action for smoke, fumes, or fire in the cockpit:

e Go to 100% oxygen and emergency on the regulator.

e Ifrequired, turn and pull the emergency vent handle when you are
below 18,000 feet (below 25,000 feet if situation warrants).

e = Follow steps listed in your checklist.

Attempt to trace the source of unidentified smoke or fumes. (Electrical
smoke is usually white or grey in color).

e If cockpit visibility is restricted, jettison the canopy.

WARNING

If the cockpit is the source of smoke or
fumes, jettisoning the canopy may cause
an eruption of flames around the
occupants.

ACG-4 D - 46


Text from ACG-4_Electrical_System_page_53.jpeg:
AMAD Failure

An AMAD failure is indicated by the simultaneous loss of the PC system,
the utility pump, and the generator on the same side.

The corrective action is to position the throttle to idle, reduce electrical
requirements, and then refer to the checklist for a list of inoperative
equipment.

Double AMAD Failure

If double AMAD failure occurs, total electrical and hydraulic power is lost
and aircraft control is not possible. EJECT.

Text from ACG-4_Electrical_System_page_56.jpeg:
ANSWERS

1. During a normal start, you can verify the emergency generator is
on-line by noting that the right engine rpm registers on the engine
monitor display (EMD). The fan turbine inlet temperature (FTIT) is
too low at this point to display.

When a main generator comes on-line, the EMER BST ON and R or
L GEN cautions illuminate to show that both emergency generator
and emergency boost pump are operating properly.

2. EMER BST ON will be displayed. It is important because it is the
only indication that the emergency generator is working.

Situation A: (Questions 3-6) During flight, you notice the loss of
many systems and equipment. The MASTER CAUTION is
illuminated and the L GEN, R GEN, and EMER BST ON cautions
are displayed.

3. The malfunction is double generator failure.

4. Because the BST SYS MAL caution is not displayed, and EMER BST
ON is displayed, the emergency generator is operating.

5. Try to restore one or both of the generators by cycling the generator
switches.

6. The corrective action brought the left main generator back on-line
and restored power to all the electrical equipment. The right main
generator remained failed resulting in the R GEN and EMER BST
ON cautions continuing to be displayed.

Situation B: (Questions 7-8) During flight, you have lost both main
generators and are using the emergency generator as the primary
source of electrical power. Weather and available facilities require
that you make an ILS approach if you wish to land at Seymour
Johnson AFB.

7. No

8. ILS is inoperative with both main generators failed (see your
checklist). Go to your alternate.

EMER BST ON is displayed. If the emergency generator is
inoperative, the BST SYS MAL caution is also displayed.

Check for a hydraulic caution/low pressure and also check the engine
instruments.

The hydraulic caution/low pressure indicates a possible AMAD
failure and the engine instruments indicate engine stall/stagnation,
or flameout.

Situation D: (Questions 12-14) During flight, the MASTER
CAUTION illuminates. You note that PC1 A, PC1 B, EMER BST ON
and L PUMP are displayed on the MPD. You then check the caution

A left AMAD failure.

Reduce the throttle to IDLE, reduce electrical requirements, and
refer to Electrical and Hydraulic Failures.

The emergency generator is operating since EMER BST ON is
displayed and the BST SYS MAL caution is not displayed.

Situation E: (Questions 15-18) During flight, you notice the
MASTER CAUTION illuminate. You note that R BST PUMP, EMER
BST ON, and BST SYS MAL cautions are displayed.

The malfunction is a right boost pump failure.

The EMER BST ON indicates that the emergency boost pump is
operating; however, since the BST SYS MAL caution is displayed, the
emergency fuel boost pump is being powered by an abnormal
electrical source.

A main generator.

No. Cycling the emergency generator to ISOLATE may fail the
emergency fuel boost pump (refer to Boost Pump Failure).

TEXT
ELECTRICAL SYSTEM COMPONENTS

The electrical power system for the F-15E consists of two main AC
generators, three transformer rectifiers (TRs), a hydraulically driven
emergency generator, and a power distribution (bus) system (Figure D-1).
The main generators are driven by the airframe mounted accessory drive
(AMAD).

The main generators produce 115 volt AC power and three TRs convert
the AC to 28 volt DC. During typical operation, each main generator
powers its own separate AC/DC bus. Each has the capacity to supply all
the basic aircraft electrical requirements. If a fault is detected in one
system, either generator picks up the load of the other automatically.

The emergency generator automatically comes on when one or both of the
main generators fail or are turned off. The emergency generator can
power systems necessary for a safe recovery.
