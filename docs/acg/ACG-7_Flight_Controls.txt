Pitch Trim Compensator

Manual trim is controlled by the trim button on the stick, which changes
the neutral position of the longitudinal feel spring. This determines the
neutral (zero force) position of the stick. Automatic pitch trim is done
through a combination of the pitch trim compensator (PTC) and the
control augmentation system (CAS). It is a series input downstream of
the stick that compensates for changes in airspeed or configuration,
without manual trim inputs. It changes the stab position without moving
the stick. A rough estimate of the required auto trim input is made by the
pitch trim compensator. However, the primary calculation is supplied by
the CAS through an interconnect. The automatic pitch trim also drives to
a midrange position and locks if UTL A/PC2 A hydraulic pressure is lost
or the pitch ratio switch is placed to EMERG.

Roll Ratio Changer

The roll ratio changer works much the same as the pitch ratio changer to
give a relatively constant roll response for a given lateral stick input. For
example, at high speed the ratio is lower than at low speed. However, its
job is more complex since pitch (AOA) is also a factor in figuring roll
sensitivity. The roll ratio changer looks at longitudinal stick position
(approximate predictor of AOA) before computing the ratio between stick
movement and aileron/differential stab deflection in order to prevent
adverse yaw.

Also, at aft stick positions the ratio to the ailerons/stabs is lower. Unlike
the pitch ratio changer, there is no gauge that displays the roll ratio.

When roll inputs are being “washed out” due to aft stick, a corresponding
input is made to the ARI to blend in some rudder. The roll ratio will also
go to midrange and lock if hydraulic pressure is lost or the roll ratio switch
is placed to EMERG. A spin recovery aid provides full lateral control
authority, regardless of longitudinal stick position, when the yaw rate
exceeds 41.5°/sec and remains greater than 30°/sec for 5 seconds. If the
yaw rate exceeds 57°/sec, the spin recovery aid is available immediately.
Normal control authority resumes when the yaw rate drops below 30°/sec.
Full aileron/differential stab authority is also available with the landing
gear down.

Hydromechanical Aileron-Rudder Interconnect (HM ARI)

The HM ARI is mechanically linked to the stick, the rudder pedals and the
PRCA. It estimates and applies coordinated rudder based on lateral and
longitudinal stick input. As the stick is moved aft of center, the HM ARI
applies more and more rudder for a given lateral stick position (up to 15°
of rudder per inch of lateral stick movement). As the stick is moved
forward of center, the HM ARI applies rudder in the opposite direction (up
to 7.5° of rudder per inch of lateral stick movement). HM ARI inputs are
always summed with rudder pedal inputs. The ARI does not work if the
PRCA is inop; so, if UTL A/PC2 A is lost or if pitch or roll ratios are in
EMERG, the ARI is inop. Above Mach 1.0, HR ARI rudder input is not
desired, so the HM ARI is automatically disengaged. ARI is also
disengaged when the wheels are spinning at 50 knots or faster during
takeoff or landing so that the ARI does not interfere with pilot flight
control movements. However, if the anti-skid switch is placed to PULSER
or OFF, the ARI is cut out as soon as the gear handle is placed down.

Rudder Pedal Travel Limiter

To prevent the rudder pedals from moving the rudders too far in high
speed flight, a rudder pedal travel limiter is provided in each cockpit. It
physically limits pedal travel to 1/3 of normal (which displaces the rudder
about 5°) when above Mach 1.5 and retracts when the speed drops below
it.

AUTOMATIC FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM (AFCS)

The AFCS is the “electrical” part of the flight control system that parallels
the HM system. It is made up of the control augmentation system (CAS)
and the autopilot (Figure D-4).

ACG-7 D-8


Text from ACG-7_Flight_Controls_page_15.jpeg:
The CAS is a three axis, three channel fly-by-wire flight control system
that overlays and tracks the HM system (Figure D-5). It normally works
with the HM system but is capable of adequate control on its own. It
takes aircrew commands, measured by the stick force sensors and rudder
pedal position transducers, and compares them to the aircraft response
measured by motion sensors (accelerometers, rate gyros, AOA sensors).
The flight control computer (FCC) then refines the commands by adding
or subtracting control surface displacement until the airplane response is
precisely that requested.

D-9 ACG-7


Text from ACG-7_Flight_Controls_page_16.jpeg:
The CAS provides a redundant capability for stability augmentation,
damping and HM refinement in the pitch, roll and yaw axes. There are
three channels in each axis. The inputs, computations and outputs made
are triplex (i.e., there are three separate accelerometers per axis, triplex
voting logic in the flight control computer, etc). If one channel in any axis
disagrees with the other two, failure monitoring automatically removes
the failed channel’s computation from that axis; however, the CAS
continues operating on the two good channels (fail-operate). A subsequent
“like” failure in one of the two remaining channels causes that CAS axis to
disengage, leaving only the HM system to operate the controls (fail-safe).

In addition to providing stability augmentation and refined handling, the
CAS ARI (through the yaw axis) performs a function similar to that of the
hydromechanical ARI. Whereas the HM ARI feeds in rudder as a function
of stick position, the CAS ARI feeds in rudder as a function of roll rate and
AOA and is, more accurately, a roll-rudder interconnect system. CAS ARI
disengages at greater than or equal to Mach 1.5, wheel spin-up to greater
than or equal to 50 knots and negative AOA.

During a spin, the CAS drops off line (greater than 41.5° yaw rate) and
cannot be reset while the spin condition exists in order to prevent pro-spin
control inputs. However, a Direct Electric Link (DEL) is activated to
provide a direct electrical interconnect from the lateral stick to the
stabilator actuators, which enables the pilot to command maximum
differential stabilators for spin recovery.

ACG-7 D-10


Text from ACG-7_Flight_Controls_page_17.jpeg:
Pitch CAS

The pitch CAS functions as shown in Figure D-6. It can command 10° of
stab travel from the HM input, which gives it quite a bit of authority. It
tracks the HM pitch system through the CAS interconnect (CAST)
servoloop. At higher AOA, pitch CAS inputs are proportionally reduced to
give a more normal feel (i.e., more aft stick force required for higher pitch
attitude/rate). Pitch CAS will disengage if two of the triplex channels fail
or if the CAS-HM interconnect fails. Also, pitch CAS will disengage if it
detects a yaw rate of 41.5°/sec to preclude the possibility of making
pro-spin inputs.

Roll CAS

The roll CAS works basically the same as pitch CAS (Figure D-7). It
provides 5° differential authority over stab movement; it makes no input
to the ailerons. Roll CAS is cut out above 30 units of AOA for spin
prevention and has full authority on the ground at wheel spin-up

(50 knots) to aid in crosswind landing control. It disengages if two
channels fail and if either pitch or yaw CAS fails. It can be reset for a
pitch-only failure but remains disengaged if yaw CAS fails.

Yaw CAS

As you might expect, the yaw CAS functions are basically the same as
pitch and roll CAS (Figure D-8). Its authority is 15°. CAS ARI is provided
by yaw CAS. Yaw CAS has 3.75° of authority to keep the ball centered;
therefore, manual rudder trim is normally not used. Fail logic/
disengagement is the same as that for pitch and roll; it also cuts out above
41.5°/sec yaw rate.

CAS Switches

These switches control the three CAS axes and they function as follows:
ON Allows normal operation after engagement.

RESET Engages a disconnected axis providing no fault exists; the
switch is spring loaded from RESET to ON.

OFF Disengages the applicable axis; lever locked position.

D-17 ACG-7


Text from ACG-7_Flight_Controls_page_24.jpeg:
The CAS channels should be engaged from left to right (yaw-roll-pitch).

To reengage any one of the CAS channels, you momentarily go to the reset
position which engages it, provided there is no malfunction in that
channel. If you lose pitch CAS, the roll CAS will also disengage. You can
reset the roll channel if nothing is wrong with it, even if the pitch channel
will not reset. However, if you lose yaw CAS, roll will not reset until yaw
CAS does.

TF Couple Switch

This two-position switch couples the automatic terrain following mode.

Takeoff Trim Button and Light

When the takeoff trim button is pressed, it drives the stick and rudder
pedal feel springs to the takeoff position. This, in turn, moves the cockpit
controls to their takeoff location and positions the rudders and ailerons to
neutral and the stabs in a symmetrical, slightly nose up attitude. This
provides maximum pitch authority for rotation at takeoff. The “YAW
RATE, YAW RATE” voice warning and yaw rate departure warning tone
sounds (900 Hz beeping tone corresponding to a yaw rate of approximately
30°/sec) and the take off trim light comes on when the button is depressed
and the flight control surfaces and flight controls are in the proper
position. The tone and light go off when the button is released.

BIT Push Button

The BIT button on the CAS panel is used in concert with the paddle
switch on the stick to clear AFCS BIT codes. To clear AFCS BIT codes,
press and hold the paddle switch, and then press and release the BIT
button. The AFCS BIT codes are cleared prior to flight control group
checks.

The BIT button is also used in concert with the MPD/MPCD BIT display

to initiate an AFCS BIT. AFCS BIT initiation is described later in this
workbook.

Pitch Ratio Switch and Indicator

The pitch ratio switch and gauge are located next to the landing gear
handle in the front cockpit (Figure D-12). With the switch in AUTO, the
computing functions of the CSBPC work normally. If the switch is placed
to EMERG, the pitch ratio changer drives to the midrange of .3 to .5 and
locks; also, automatic pitch trim locks in midrange and the HM ARI is
disabled.

Text from ACG-7_Flight_Controls_page_27.jpeg:
Rudder Trim Switch

Located in the right rear corner of both throttle quadrants, this switch
changes the neutral position of the rudder feel spring and the rudder
pedals. Normally, the yaw CAS makes use of this switch unnecessary.
Warning Tones

There are three warning tones that sound to indicate potentially
hazardous flight regimes: gear down AOA tone, departure warning tone

and high AOA warning tone.

Landing Gear AOA Tone

This 1600 Hz AOA warning tone beeps in flight when the angle-of-attack
reaches approximately 30 units with the gear down. The beep rate
increases with increasing AOA and does not stop until the AOA is reduced
below 30 units.

High AOA Tone

A programmable high AOA warning tone incorporates a 900 Hz tone
doublet (two short 10 Hz beeps followed by a 0.3 second pause) to cue the
aircrew when the programmed AOA is exceeded. The AOA setting is
changed at PB #15 on the HUD repeater display. The system defaults to
30 units AOA at aircraft power up with CFTs, external A/G stores and
miscellaneous stores; but can be programmed for 20 to 45 units AOA. For
all other loadings the system defaults to off (to include A/A only). If the
value is set at 46-50 units AOA, the tone is also off. Programming can be
done on the ground or airborne. The warning tone is heard and the HUD
AOA flashes when the programmed limit is equaled or exceeded.

D-21 ACG-7


Text from ACG-7_Flight_Controls_page_28.jpeg:
Departure Warning Tone

The departure warning tone provides warning of an impending departure
and warns the aircrew of improper control inputs and excessive yaw rates.
The required pilot action for excessive yaw rate is to smoothly neutralize
the controls.

Departure warning tone activation generates the “YAW RATE, YAW
RATE” voice warning followed by a 900 Hz beeping tone when the yaw
rate (under certain conditions) exceeds 15°/sec. As the yaw rate increases,
the beep rate increases, reaching a maximum at 60°/sec yaw rate. This
tone is the same as the one heard when setting the T/O Trim (beep rate
for approximately 30°/sec yaw rate).

The departure warning, the overload warning system and the high AOA
warning all use the same 900 Hz tone. However, each tone uses a
different repeat rate and the departure warning tone has priority over the
other tones.

Spin Recovery Display (SRD)

The purpose of the SRD is to provide information to help the aircrew
recover from an up-right or inverted spin and verify the out-of-control
condition is a spin and not an auto-roll. When the flight control computer
detects a spin condition, the CC displays an SRD on all MPD/MPCDs
(Figure D-14), LAWS is reset to activate at 10,000’ AGL and again at
5000’ AGL, and the VTRS split screen records the HUD and FCP left MPD
until 30 seconds after recovery. “SPIN RECOVERY?” is displayed and an
arrow indicates the required stick position (full left/full right), and throttle
position bars indicate recommended throttle placement (idle/mil) for an
upright spin. “CONTROLS NEUTRAL?” is displayed for an inverted spin.

stick arrow is removed. Four seconds after “RECOVER” is shown on the
SRD, all displays return to their pre-spin assigned format.

The SRD is not a selectable format and cannot be tested on the ground.

MALFUNCTION INDICATIONS

Flight control malfunction indications are presented in the cockpit in two
different ways. Some are displayed on the FCP right MPD and RCP right
MPCD and cause the FLT CONTR major category caution light and
MASTER CAUTION light to illuminate. Others are displayed on the
BIT/DETAIL/AFCS/STATUS page. These trigger the AV BIT, FLT
CONTR and MASTER CAUTION lights.

Flight Control Caution Light

The amber flight control caution light, labeled FLT CONTR, is one of the
major category lights on the caution lights panel (Figure D-15). The
purpose of the flight control caution light is to prompt you to check the
MPD/MPCD for a specific caution from that category, or if it illuminates
in conjunction with the AV BIT light, to check the BIT/DETAIL/AFCS/
STATUS page for other flight control anomalies.

AV BIT Functional Failure Summaries

The following are AFCS functional failures that can be displayed on the
BIT/DETAIL/AFCS/STATUS page. They give an enhanced status of the
flight control system. They are also covered in the in-flight checklist.
(Refer to TO 1F-15E-1, Chapter 3, AFCS Functional Status Summary.)

PCAS FIRST FAIL

RCAS FIRST FAIL

YCAS FIRST FAIL

CASI SERVOLOOP

SPIN RECOVERY

ACG-7

Indicates one channel of the pitch CAS has
failed. The system remains functional with a
single failure, but attempt a reset to clear the
fault. If reset fails with CFT stores and wing
tanks, slow to 450 KCAS or less.

Same as pitch CAS except in the roll axis.
Not necessary to slow down.

Same as pitch CAS except in the yaw axis.
Not necessary to slow down.

The link between the pitch CAS and the
hydromechanical system has failed (pitch and
roll CAS will also fail). You would have to
select pitch ratio EMERG when straight and
level below 300 KCAS, and then reset the
pitch CAS.

Indicates full mechanical roll authority may

be incorrectly selected and the spin recovery

aid may not be available. Do not exceed one-
half lateral stick input or 30 units AOA.

In conjunction with yaw CAS failure,
indicates full mechanical authority will not be
selected in a spin and DEL mode may not be
available. Attempt to reset yaw CAS.

ROLL LIMIT

AOA FAIL

May appear in conjunction with pitch and roll
CAS failure. Indicates RCP stick force sensor
has failed. Pitch CAS and roll will fail but
should reset. RCP stick inputs result in
reduced performance and RCP G capability is
limited to 3.5 Gs maximum.

May appear in conjunction with yaw CAS
failure. Indicates rudder pedal position
sensor has failed. Larger pedal inputs are
required to overcome CAS for equivalent
response. Normal mechanical plus
dampening is available. If yaw CAS does not
reset, limit AOA to below 30 units.

May appear in conjunction with the lateral
stick limit caution. Indicates rudder servo
has failed. CAS gain is doubled to the
remaining rudder; total rudder power is
reduced. Limit flight to below Mach 1.0 and
less than % lateral stick inputs.

Indicates CAS ARI has failed or has been
disengaged due to related failures. Above 30
units pilot must use rudder to make
coordinated flight control inputs. May appear
with other fails (i.e., AOA FAIL, ROLL
LIMIT). Mechanical ARI is still available.

Cross check standby airspeed with HUD
airspeed. If significant disagreement, limit
lateral stick inputs to one-half. Lateral roll
authority and pitch ratio may be incorrect.
Limit AOA to 30 units. At airspeeds above
550 KCAS/Mach 1.0, also limit lateral stick
inputs to one-half.

May appear in conjunction with lateral stick
limit caution. Indicates AOA source
disagreement. Limit stick inputs to one-half
and maintain AOA below 30 units.

MALFUNCTION ACTIONS
General

If you detect or suspect a flight control malfunction while airborne, there
are a few general rules to follow. First, terminate your maneuvering,
climb to a safe altitude and slow down. Check the cockpit for warnings,
cautions and advisory messages on the BIT/Detail page. If the CAS is off,
attempt to reset. If the CAS is on, do not turn it off. It may be the only
reason you are still in control. Refer to the checklist procedure and/or the
AFCS functional status summary pages to determine actions. In most
situations, a controllability check is a good idea to preclude surprises in
the landing pattern. Know the system; know and use the checklist.

Pitch Ratio Failure

A pitch ratio malfunction may be detected by the appropriate caution
indications or by abnormal pitch response (too much or too little
oscillation). You can check the pitch ratio indicator for readings that are
obviously incorrect or fluctuating.

As with any malfunction or emergency, refer to the checklist. EMERG
should only be tried if pitch CAS is still on line or the airspeed is below
300 KCAS. Once below 300 knots, look at the pitch ratio indicator. If it
reads below .3 or if oscillations are making control difficult, you can
improve handling by selecting EMERG on the pitch ratio switch. This will
also deactivate the HM ARI and lock the automatic pitch trim at
midrange. As long as CAS is on line, control should be adequate for flight.
Consider a controllability check prior to landing from a straight-in
approach. If the pitch ratio fails during takeoff with the pitch CAS off,
abort the takeoff if conditions permit.

ACG-7 D - 32


Text from ACG-7_Flight_Controls_page_39.jpeg:
Roll Ratio Failure

A roll ratio problem may be detected by the appropriate caution
indications or by abnormal roll response. Evaluate handling qualities at
approach speed with roll ratio in both AUTO and EMERG. EMERG cuts
out the HM ARI but gives a moderate roll response. It may reduce the
ability to level a heavy wing. With roll CAS off and roll ratio in EMERG,
do not exceed 18 units AOA with large lateral asymmetry.

Pitch CAS Failure with AFT CG

If pitch CAS failure occurs with CG near the aft limit, handling qualities
will be significantly degraded at low altitudes. Short, quick stick inputs
will be required to preclude a PIO. You will have to slow the aircraft
without using the speed brake (the speed brake may cause an
uncontrollable pitch down). Evaluate handling qualities at slow speed.
You may have to jettison external stores in order to maintain adequate
aircraft control.

Lateral Stick Limit Caution

Reduce AOA below 30 units, limit lateral stick inputs to one-half, and
check the BIT/DETAIL/AFCS/STATUS display. Several combination
failures with LAT STK LMT caution are possible. Refer to the AFCS
functional status summary.

NOTE

LAT STK LIMIT and YAW CAS cautions may be displayed after a

single engine shutdown. This is normal—attempt a YAW CAS reset.

Trim

If the trim runs away in any direction, the aircraft is still completely
controllable. Unless other flight control malfunctions are evident, leave
the pitch and roll ratios in AUTO. Slow below 250 knots and if the
condition cannot be controlled with normal trim controls, push the take off
trim button. Pulling the AFCS ESS AC circuit breaker (upper-pitch trim,
lower yaw and roll trim) removes power from the trim actuators. So,
while holding the trim neutral, pull the appropriate circuit breakers.

Text from ACG-7_Flight_Controls_page_40.jpeg:
Hydraulic Failure (UTL A/PC2 A)

Loss of both the UTL A and PC2 A circuits has the same effect as placing
the pitch and roll ratio switches to EMERG. The ratios lock at midrange,
automatic pitch trim is lost and the HM ARI is inop.

Rudder System Malfunctions (Deflected Rudder Malfunctions)

If a rudder control cable is broken or jammed, flight control inputs, which
cause rudder movement, will probably result in irreversible deflection of
one or both rudders. Failure of a rudder actuator may cause that rudder
to go hardover in one direction. These conditions can be confirmed
visually; the aircraft should be controllable as long as the CAS is engaged.
Do not turn the CAS off. Avoid unnecessary G loading since aircraft
control will be reduced as AOA increases. Consider using asymmetrical
thrust.

Rudder Limit Caution

Above Mach 1.5, limit rudder inputs to 1/3 to avoid excessive slide slip
conditions. Below Mach 1.5, rudder pedal travel should be checked to
verify if the travel is limited or unlimited. If limited, directional control
during landing may be degraded because both rudder and nosewheel
steering inputs will be limited. Pulling the right air inlet control circuit
breaker in the rear cockpit may restore rudder pedal travel for landing
(cuts power to the rudder limiter). However, the right inlet will move to
the full up and locked position. If normal rudder travel cannot be
regained, consider an approach end arrestment.

CAS Failure

Without the CAS, control is still provided by the HM system in a given
axis; however, no stability augmentation or refined handling modifications
are provided. As long as the HM system is operating normally, loss of the
CAS causes only slight degradation of aircraft control. It will probably
feel sensitive at high speed and sloppy at slow speed. If the CAS fails,
attempt to reset. If the CAS keeps failing, leave it off to preclude a
surprise disengagement during landing or other critical phase of flight. If
yaw CAS fails and will not reset, maintain AOA below 30 units.

ACG-7 D - 34


Text from ACG-7_Flight_Controls_page_41.jpeg:
Combined Failures

Combined failures of both the CAS and HM systems can result in severely
degraded aircraft control. For example, with loss of UTL A/PC2 A and
simultaneous loss of the CAS, pitch and roll ratios drive to EMERG,
automatic pitch trim and ARI are inop, and there is no CAS to “take up
the slack.” With CFTs installed, a 3 G nose up transient may occur. You
will have to concentrate hard on just flying the aircraft. With pitch CAS
inoperative and pitch ratio in EMERG, the maximum attainable AOA at
touchdown speed is only 21 units, so the procedure is to fly a flat 18 unit
approach. There is a good discussion of combination failures in Section VI
of the Dash-1.

Controllability Check

A controllability check is a good idea for an indicated or suspected flight
control problem. Refer to the checklist/flight manual.

Anti-Skid Caution

Although not part of the flight control system, the anti-skid will affect the
operation of the hydromechanical ARI as already mentioned. Realize that
if the anti-skid fails and the switch is left in NORM, the ARI may not
disengage upon landing.

SURVIVABILITY

While there are some flight control malfunctions that significantly affect
handling quality, the system is highly redundant and very survivable in a
combat environment.

Electrical Loss

If all electrical power is lost, control is maintained through the mechanical
system to operate ailerons, stabs and rudders (Figure D-20). Basic control
is still there, but degraded with pitch and roll ratios in emergency and
CAS’s off line.

Mechanical Loss

If any or all mechanical controls are jammed, limited control can still be
maintained by the CAS. The stabilators will function for pitch and roll
and both rudders are still available (Figure D-20). The only things you do
not have are ailerons.

Text from ACG-7_Flight_Controls_page_43.jpeg:
Loss of Both PC Hydraulic Systems

If both primary flight control hydraulic systems (PC1 and PC2) are lost,
the utility hydraulic system supplies power to all primary flight controls
(Figure D-20).

Mixed Hydraulic Losses

When either PC hydraulic system plus the utility hydraulic system are
lost (not a common occurrence), control is maintained with one aileron,
one rudder, and stabilators for pitch and roll (Figure D-20). Also, note
that one flap is failed on the “dead wing” in this case.

FLIGHT CONTROL GROUND CHECKS

The aircrew must advise the ground crew prior to conducting flight control
checks. The hydromechanical system is checked first to ensure proper
deflection of the control surfaces, including the pitch trim compensator.
The surfaces should deflect in the same manner as in the CAS ON check
(Table D-3) with the major exception being only 15° (HM) of rudder
deflection versus 30° (HM+CAS). Notice that the stabilators will deflect
differentially when the stick is put left or right of neutral.

Place the pitch ratio switch to emergency (check gauge 0.3 to 0.5). After

Verify no BIT codes or failures on the BIT/DETAIL/AFCS/STATUS and

neutral to verify trim function and apply T/O trim to move the flight
controls to the take off position. (T/O trim light, voice warnings, and

AFCS BIT

To start the AFCS BIT, press and hold the BIT button on the CAS panel,
and then press and release the AFCS BIT push button on the MPD/MPCD
BIT display. “AFCS IN TEST” will appear on the MPD/MPCD BIT
display when the AFCS BIT begins. Release the BIT button on the CAS
panel once the AFCS BIT is initiated. The AFCS BIT runs automatically
after initiation. The AFCS BIT will not run unless the holding brake is
ON and the aircraft senses weight on the wheels. The AFCS BIT option is
not available while airborne. The complete BIT takes approximately

1 minute and 40 seconds.
WARNING

AFCS BIT will cycle the controls and
the control surfaces. Flight and
ground crew must stay clear of the
flight control system while AFCS BIT
is IN TEST.

Upon completion of the AFCS BIT, reset CAS and check BIT/DETAIL/
AFCS/STATUS and FAULTS pages for any BIT malfunctions. Checking
the FAULTS and STATUS pages should always be done since “AFCS*”
may not always be displayed on the BIT pages to alert the aircrew of
AFCS BIT problems.

NOTE

The preflight flight control checks are covered in detail in the lecture.

FLIGHT CONTROL SURFACES

The F-15E flight control system is designed to provide excellent handling
characteristics and flight path control throughout the aircraft’s extensive
flight envelope. It incorporates both a hydromechanical system (HM) and
an automatic flight control system (AFCS). These two systems were made
to work together in harmony to give manual and automatic control of the
airplane. The two also provide redundancy in that the aircraft can be
safely flown using the AFCS alone following HM jams. Likewise, the
airplane can easily be flown with just the hydromechanical system
operating.

The primary flight control surfaces consist of conventional ailerons, twin
rudders and stabilators, which move collectively for pitch and
differentially for roll (Figure D-1). Stabilators and rudders are operated
by both the hydromechanical and automatic systems; however, the
ailerons work only through the HM system. Spring cartridges are
incorporated, providing artificial “feel” to the aircrew.

Control Stick Boost Pitch Compensator (CSBPC)

Hydraulic power from the Utility A circuit, backed up by PC2 A, provides
the force to adjust the ratios, trim inputs and interconnects between the
different controls. This “power steering” is collectively called the control
stick boost/pitch compensator (CSBPC). There is no single box labeled
“CSBPC”; rather, it is a combination of two separate assemblies: the pitch
and roll channel assembly (PRCA) and the aileron-rudder interconnect
(ARD.

Pitch and Roll Channel Assembly

The PRCA is made up of a pitch ratio changer, a pitch trim compensator
and a roll ratio changer. They provide the same pitch/roll response for a
given stick deflection, regardless of airspeed, plus an automatic pitch trim
feature.

Pitch Ratio Changer

The pitch ratio changer uses pitot-static inputs of altitude and airspeed to
determine an appropriate ratio between longitudinal stick movement and
stabilator displacement. The intent is to produce a consistent pitch
response (constant G for a given stick position) throughout the flight
envelope (two Gs per inch of stick movement). Each G requires
approximately 4.25 pounds of stick-force.

The pitch ratio is displayed to the pilot as a decimal fraction between one
and zero. For example, at low speeds (<250 KCAS) the ratio should read
near 1.0, indicating maximum stabilator authority. As speed increases
the ratio decreases. At about Mach 0.9 at low altitude, where the aircraft
is much more pitch sensitive, the ratio should read near zero. As speed is
increased above Mach 1.0, the ratio starts to climb providing more
stabilator authority. When hydraulic power is lost (UTL A/PC2 A
failures), the pitch ratio reverts to a fixed midrange value and locks. This
is displayed on the pitch ratio indicator by the needle indicating 0.3 to 0.5.
This setting is also selected by placing the pitch ratio switch to EMERG.
