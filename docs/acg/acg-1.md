#### Design Philosophy

* **Low-Risk Approach:**  Leveraged existing F-15 capabilities to meet USAF requirements for a survivable deep interdiction aircraft. 
* **Modifications:** Primarily focused on enhancing penetration and precision weapon delivery in all weather conditions, day or night.
* **Airframe/Systems:** Relatively minor changes required.
* **Cockpit:**  Substantial modifications to accommodate LANTIRN (Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night) and reduce crew workload. 
* **Design Refinement:**  Many "changes" were already approved for the F-15A/C and represent system improvements rather than completely new developments. 

##### Cockpit Design

* **Workload Reduction and Task Simplification:** Key design goals. 
* **Multiple Displays:**
    * MPDs (Multipurpose Displays).
    * MPCDs (Multipurpose Color Displays).

    Provide simultaneous access to sensor, weapon, and advisory data, minimizing display sequencing.

* **Color Displays:** Enhance data interpretation.
* **Integrated Upfront Control (UFC):** For operating CNI (Communications, Navigation, and Identification) systems. 
* **Hand Controllers:**  Enable quick mode changes, display option selection, and sensor/weapon management. 
* **Ergonomics:** Displays and controls are within easy reach and strategically positioned for optimal viewing.

##### Display Operation

* **Menu-Driven:** Utilize prompting menus for sensor modes, submodes, and advisory formats. 
* **System Integration:** Cockpit controls, instrumentation, and displays are integrated for maximum operational flexibility.

##### Crew Coordination

Essential for managing the extensive cockpit flexibility. Develop a plan to avoid redundant efforts and ensure all tasks are completed.

    * Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR)
    * Target detection, identification, and designation (day/night)
    * Target acquisition and track
    * Automatic target handoff to Maverick missiles

* **Integrated Radar Altimeter:** Used for automatic terrain following and manual flight. 

#### F100-PW-220 Engine

* **Replacement:**  For the F100-PW-100. 
* **Advantages:**
    * Easier maintenance.
    * Improved responsiveness.
    * Longer service life.
    * Computer-controlled for optimal performance.

#### F100-PW-229 (IPE)

* **Aircraft:**  F-15Es with tail numbers 90-0233 and higher.

#### Tactical Electronic Warfare System (TEWS)

* **Components:**
    * ALQ-135 Internal Countermeasures Set (ICS)
    * ALQ-128 Electronic Warfare Warning Set (EWWS)
    * ALR-56C Radar Warning Receiver (RWR)
    * ALE-45 Countermeasure Dispenser (CMD) set

#### Inertial Navigation System (INS)

* **Type:**  Self-contained, fully automatic ring laser gyro (RLG) system. 
* **Functions:**
    * Primary attitude reference.
    * Continuous present position (PP) monitoring. 

* **Alignment Times:**
    * Stored heading: 40 seconds.
    * Full: 4 minutes.

* **Accuracy:** ~0.8 nm/hour. 
* **Reliability:** 2,000 hours MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure).
* **Power:** Operable on emergency generator power. 

#### APG-70 Radar A/G Functions

##### Retained Capabilities

All F-15C air-to-air modes and capabilities. 

##### New A/G Modes

* High Resolution Map (HRM)
* Real Beam Map (RBM)
* Precision Velocity Update (PVU)

##### High Resolution Map (HRM)

* **Function:** Accurate long-range designation and LANTIRN targeting pod cueing.
* **Resolution:** 8.5 - 1,014 feet (depending on map size and range).
* **Availability:** 
    * Not available within 8° of the aircraft's velocity vector. 
    * Available throughout the PPI (Plan Position Indicator) scan.

##### Real Beam Map (RBM)

* **Function:**  Rapid large-area mapping.
* **Capabilities:**
    * Mapping along the velocity vector.
    * Backup targeting pod cueing (large, discrete targets).
    * Terrain feature display for low-altitude navigation assistance.
    * Weather detection (using manual antenna elevation control and pencil beam). 

##### Precision Velocity Update (PVU)

* **Purpose:**  Refine ownship velocity estimate (more accurate than INS data). 
* **Requirement:**  LANTIRN's narrow FOV requires velocity accuracy within 1 FPS for target designation from radar maps at ranges ≥ 10 nm.
* **Processing:**  Uses coherent Doppler processing in HRM mode to display target returns at the correct azimuth based on aircraft velocity. 

#### Missionized Cockpits

* **Both Cockpits:**  Arranged to improve situational awareness and minimize workload.

    * UFC. 

* **Display Flexibility:**  Either crew member can view displays controlled by the other.

### Cockpit Familiarization

#### HOTAS (Hands On Throttle And Stick) Philosophy

* **Retained:**  From the F-15, implemented in both cockpits.

#### Control Integration

* **Menu-Driven Interface:**  Replaces traditional control panels, integrating system functions into display formats.
* **Example:** Radar controls are now within the A/A radar display, eliminating the need for a dedicated panel.

#### Additional Familiarization

* **Instructor-Led:** Provided in class.
* **References:** 
    * Foldouts 5 and 7 in the Dash 1.
    * Handout section of this workbook. 

#### Multipurpose Display Group

The F-15E cockpits have few dedicated controls and displays, relying primarily on MPDs and MPCDs for system access and data presentation (Figure D-3).
