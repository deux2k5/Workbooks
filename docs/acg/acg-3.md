### Capabilities & Limitations

#### Capabilities

The F-15E fuel system is designed for damage resistance and survivability:

* Tanks and lines are self-sealing and/or contain polyether-based foam for fire/explosion protection.
* The new foam doesn't break down over time or contaminate fuel.
* Fuel lines are routed inside tanks where possible, and are self-sealing when outside.
* Fuselage tanks are surrounded by explosion suppression foam.

Benefits of maximum fuel load:
* Extended range
* Increased combat mission flexibility
* Sustained afterburner operations

A typical combat radius with a mix of bombs and missiles is 450 nm. Cross-country flights with maximum fuel can exceed 2000 miles (depending on winds and fuel reserves).

#### Limitations

* High fuel consumption: At low altitude in full AB, total fuel flow can exceed 150,000 lbs/hour.
* Maximum transfer rate: 117,000 lbs/hour.
* Potential issue: Engine feed tanks could empty with fuel still onboard, leading to flameout.

Specific restrictions for fuel system malfunctions are covered in the malfunctions section.

### Capacities

F-15E fuel capacity varies based on configuration and mission requirements. Tank capacities (using JP-8 at 65Â°F):

* Tank 1: ~4050 lbs
* Right feed (Tank 2): ~1550 lbs
* Left feed (Tank 3): ~1250 lbs
* Internal wings: ~3300 lbs each
* CFT: ~4900 lbs each
* Externals: ~4100 lbs each

Total capacity with CFTs and three external tanks: ~35,550 lbs

Example configurations:
* Full internal only: ~13,550 lbs
* Full internal plus CFTs: ~23,300 lbs
* Full internal, CFTs, and external centerline tank: ~27,350 lbs

The aircraft's handling characteristics change throughout the mission due to shifting fuel quantities affecting gross weight and center of gravity (CG).

### Description and Components

The F-15E can carry nearly as much fuel as it weighs. Fuel is stored in:
* Internal feed tanks
* Internal transfer tanks
* External wing/centerline tanks
* Conformal fuel tanks (CFTs)

All tanks can be refueled on the ground or in-flight. All fuel except that in the feed tanks can be dumped overboard. The primary fuel is JP-8, but other types may be used if required (with potential slight variations in fuel flow and performance).

#### External Tanks

* Part of the first level in the three-stage transfer/feed system.
* Use engine bleed air pressure (not pumps) to transfer fuel.
* Interchangeable between wing and centerline stations.
* Mounted on pylons attached to aircraft hardpoints.
* Only tanks without fire suppressant foam or self-sealing capability.
* Can be jettisoned regardless of fuel content ("drop tanks").

#### Conformal Fuel Tanks (CFTs)

* Also part of the first level transfer system.
* Use transfer pumps (two per tank) to move fuel to internal tanks.
* Divided into three compartments for proper CG movement during transfer.
* Bolted to engine nacelles (cannot be jettisoned).
* Contain explosion suppressant foam.

#### Transfer Tanks

* Second level in the transfer/feed hierarchy.
* Composed of tank 1 and right/left internal wing tanks.
* Each has a single pump to transfer fuel to either feed tank.
* Contain fire/explosion suppressing foam.

#### Transfer Pumps

* Located in CFTs, internal wing tanks, and tank 1.
* Normally operate on main generator power (or ground power with engine master switch on).
* CFT pumps can be controlled by a cockpit switch.
* Power hydraulic ejector pumps to ensure complete fuel transfer from tank 1 auxiliary tank and CFT forward compartments.
* Internal wing and tank 1 pumps require main generator power (won't operate on emergency power).
* CFT pumps can be selectively operated from emergency generator power in special circumstances.

#### Fuel Lines

* Two sets run from internal transfer tanks to feed tanks.
* Allow for gravity transfer if transfer pump(s) fail.
* Gravity transfer only occurs after operative transfer pumps and external tank/CFT fuel has been transferred to feed tanks.

#### Feed Tanks

* Third level of the transfer/feed system.
* Provide fuel directly to engines.
* Tanks 2 & 3 (right and left feed tanks) supply their respective engines.
* Left feed tank (3) is composed of two interconnecting tanks (3A & 3B).
* JFS gets fuel from tank 3B.
* Internal baffling allows for limited negative G or inverted flight (7 seconds max).
* Self-sealing capability and fire/explosion suppressant foam.

#### Boost Pumps

* Each feed tank has a boost pump to supply pressurized fuel to engines.
* Pressurization prevents fuel vaporization.
* Left feed tank also contains the emergency boost pump.
* Emergency boost pump activates if main boost pump(s) malfunction, a main generator fails, or both transformer rectifiers fail.
* Interconnect and crossfeed valves open between feed tanks to ensure both engines receive boosted fuel from remaining pump(s).
* Emergency generator powers the emergency boost pump in these situations.

#### Heat Exchangers

* Located between each feed tank and engine.
* Circulate cool fuel around lines containing hot AMAD oil, IDG oil, and hydraulic fluid.
* Cools the fluids while heating fuel to optimal combustion temperature.
* Recirculation valves open if fuel leaving the exchanger is too hot, routing fuel back to the internal wing tank for cooling.
* Both recirculation valves open together to prevent fuel imbalance between left/right internal wing tanks.

### System Operations

The fuel system's primary function is to maintain fuel flow to the engines through a three-stage transfer/feed hierarchy:

1. External tanks and CFTs transfer to any internal tank(s).
2. Internal wing tanks and tank 1 transfer to feed tanks.
3. Feed tanks supply boosted fuel to engines.

This design aims to keep feed tanks continuously full, even with transfer malfunctions, unless engine demand exceeds transfer rate.

#### Transfer System

##### External Tanks

* Normally transfer first (with appropriate fuel control switch settings).
* Use engine bleed air pressure (25 psi for wing tanks, 15 psi for centerline).
* Wing tanks typically transfer before centerline (aircrew can choose centerline first).
* Monitor transfer to detect malfunctions early.
* Normal for wing tanks to transfer at different rates (one may empty significantly before the other).

##### Conformal Fuel Tanks (CFTs)

* Transfer together, normally after externals are empty.
* Can "kick in" to augment externals if internal transfer tanks aren't kept full.
* Two transfer pumps per CFT (aft and center compartment sumps).
* Transfer maintains proper center of gravity.
* Float-controlled interconnect valve between center and aft compartments.
* Center pump runs an ejector pump to empty the forward compartment.
* If both CFT transfer pumps fail, that CFT's fuel cannot be transferred.

**Note:** On aircraft 90-0233 and up (after TCTO 6J14-5-11-521), the ejector pump moves to the aft compartment to aid transfer. The forward compartment gravity transfers to the center compartment.

##### Internal Wing Tanks and Tank 1

* Normally the last to deplete.
* Each has one electric transfer pump.
* Tank 1 has an ejector pump for its aux tank.
* After initial 200 lbs from tank 1, all transfer at the same rate.
* Tank 1 transfer failure can cause forward CG shift, increasing departure susceptibility.
* Restrict AOA to below 30 units if tank 1 fuel is >750 lbs more than either internal wing tank.

#### Engine Feed System

* Each feed tank provides pressurized fuel to its engine.
* Fuel passes through a heat exchanger before reaching the engine.
* System can supply both engines unless all three boost pumps fail.
* With only one working boost pump, both engines receive fuel but the operating envelope is restricted (< 30,000 ft altitude, no afterburner).
* Total boost pump failure results in suction feed with high flameout risk.
* In single-engine operation, the inoperative engine's feed tank remains full until the other reaches FUEL LOW activation. Then interconnect and crossfeed valves open to use the remaining fuel.

#### Pressurization and Vent System

* Engine bleed air pressurizes all tanks except CFTs (which use ram air).
* Pressurization prevents vaporization/boil-off at altitude.
* Bleed air pressure transfers fuel from external wing/centerline tanks.
* Pressurization depends on landing gear handle position (pressure applied with handle up, removed with handle down).
* Internal tanks vent through wing tip vents.
* CFTs have their own vents.
* External tanks vent through their pylons.
* System provides proper pressure relief during climbs and vacuum relief during descents.

### Indicators

#### Fuel Quantity Indicators

* Combined gauge in each cockpit.
* FCP gauge above JFS handle.
* RCP gauge on instrument panel next to clock (displays only internal and total fuel).

##### FCP Gauge Features:
* Top scale/pointer: Total internal fuel (thousands of pounds).
* Digital counter: Total fuel onboard.
* LEFT/RIGHT counters: Fuel quantity for selected tanks.
* Rotary fuel quantity selector knob.
* Bingo knob and index/bug (fuel quantity warning system).

##### RCP Gauge:
* Repeater gauge (internal and total fuel only).

Both gauges operate on emergency generator power if main power is unavailable. Each has an OFF flag displayed when unpowered.

### Controls

#### Fuel Control Panel

Located in the front cockpit, forward and outboard of the throttle quadrant.

##### External/Conformal Fuel Tank Control Switches

* Three 3-position switches (WING, CTR, CONF TANK).
* Control fuel transfer to/from CFTs and external tanks.
* Positions: NORM (center), STOP REFUEL, STOP TRANS.
* Require electrical power to function.
* STOP TRANS prevents transfer unless FUEL LOW caution is displayed.

**Note:** Position CFT control switch to STOP TRANS during start/pre-takeoff to prevent venting and allow tank 1 transfer. Move to NORM during the before takeoff check.

##### External Transfer Switch

* Two-position switch (WING/CTR or CONF TANK).
* Selects priority for external tanks or CFTs to transfer first.
* Important to match switch position to actual aircraft configuration.
* Incorrect selection can cause cyclic transfer patterns.

##### Ground Transfer

Similar to airborne transfer, except external tanks don't transfer (unpressurized with gear handle down).

##### Dump Switch

* Two-position switch (NORM/DUMP).
* DUMP is electrically held for automatic operations.
* Dumps to bingo bug setting or ~2750 lbs (feed tank fuel), whichever is greater.
* BINGO FUEL caution should return the switch to NORM (verify manually).
* Dump rate: ~910 PPM.
* Creates internal wing lateral imbalance (130 PPM, 1100 pounds maximum).

##### Slipway Switch

Controls air refueling functions (discussed in air refueling section).

##### Conformal Tank Emergency Transfer Switch

Discussed in the malfunction section.

#### Fuel Shutoff Valves

* Located in each fuel line, aft of heat exchanger, forward of engine main fuel control.
* Normally open.
* Can be electrically closed (2-3 seconds) by:
    * Turning off the appropriate engine master switch.
    * Pushing the associated fire push light (FCP).
* Provides alternate fuel shutoff to the main fuel control.
* Important for fuel leak situations.

### Ground Refueling

* Accomplished through single point receptacle under left engine intake.
* No electrical power required.
* External tanks can be refueled separately if needed.
* "Hot refueling" (engines running) procedures exist.

### Air Refueling

* Compatible with KC-135 or KC-10 tankers.
* Receptacle beneath slipway door (top of left engine inlet, aft of rear cockpit).
* Components:
    * Door
    * Receptacle
    * Area lighting (slipway and flood)
    * Pressure switch

#### Cockpit Controls/Indicators:
* READY light
* Slipway switch
* Emergency air refueling switch
* Air refueling release button (each stick grip)

#### Slipway Switch (3-position)

* **OPEN:**
    * Turns off CFT and tank 1 transfer pumps.
    * Opens door hydraulically.
    * If door opens:
        * Depressurizes external tanks (unless FUEL LOW is on).
        * Activates exterior refueling lights.
        * Illuminates READY light.
    * When boom contacts receptacle:
        * Locking mechanism engages.
        * READY light goes out.
        * Fuel transfers at max ~3000 lbs/minute.
    * CG control: Float switch in tank 1 prevents external tank filling until tank 1 has â¥1560 lbs.
    * CFTs start refilling regardless of tank 1 quantity.
    * Automatic or manual disconnect available.

* **CLOSE:**
    * Activates CFT transfer pumps (if switch in NORM).
    * Activates tank 1 transfer pumps.
    * Closes slipway door.
    * Repressurizes external tanks.
    * Reestablishes normal fuel sequencing.
    * Turns off exterior refueling lights and READY light.

* **ORIDE (Override):**
    * Similar to OPEN but allows refueling with certain malfunctions.
    * Differences:
        * No automatic disconnect.
        * No tanker-initiated manual disconnect.
        * Bypasses tank 1 float switch.
    * Caution: Select STOP REFUEL for external tanks until tank 1 has >1560 lbs to prevent CG issues.
    * Not for normal peacetime use unless critical due to low fuel state.

#### Emergency Air Refueling

* For situations where the slipway door won't open normally (e.g., utility hydraulic failure).
* Procedure:
    1. Slipway switch to OPEN.
    2. Emergency air refueling switch to OPEN.
    3. Pyrotechnic device fires, blowing the slipway door open.
    4. Slipway lights and READY light illuminate.
    5. READY light stays on, boom won't lock in place.
    6. Requires "pressure" refueling.
    7. Door can't be closed, but external tanks can be pressurized and transfer pumps activated by moving slipway switch to CLOSE.

### Fuel Dumping

* All fuel except feed tank fuel can be dumped.
* Dump mast located on right wing tip trailing edge.
* Activated by placing dump switch to DUMP.
* Uses transfer pumps and engine bleed air.
* Rate: ~910 lbs/minute.
* Stops when:
    1. Dump switch returned to NORM.
    2. Only feed tank fuel remains.
    3. Fuel quantity reaches bingo bug setting (returns switch to NORM).

**Caution:** Dumping possible on the ground with electrical power and switch in DUMP. Switch is not guarded, avoid accidental activation.

**Note:** The right internal wing tank dumps 20 gpm faster, causing a left-wing heavy imbalance (~130 lbs/min, max ~1100 lbs). Imbalance decreases as left wing fuel depletes below 1100 lbs.

### Malfunctions

#### Uncommanded Fuel Venting/Fuel Leak

* No specific warning/caution indicators.
* Potential signs:
    * Unexpectedly low fuel quantity.
    * Excessive fuel flow.
    * FUEL LOW warning (if severe).
* Venting may be visible to aircrew or wingman.
* Primary dangers:
    * Inability to reach recovery base.
    * Potential in-flight fire/explosion (for leaks).
* Refer to checklist for appropriate procedures.

#### Cautions and Warnings

Eight fuel system cautions:
* BINGO FUEL
* FUEL LOW
* FUEL HOT
* EMER BST ON
* BST SYS MAL
* L BST PUMP
* R BST PUMP
* XFER PUMP

Activation triggers:
* Yellow caution light on FCP (some on RCP).
* Caution message on MPD/MPCD.
* Voice warning message to both cockpits.
* MASTER CAUTION lights in both cockpits.

#### Fuel Low

* Warns of low fuel in one/both engine feed tanks.
* Independent of fuel quantity indicating system.
* Activates:
    * FUEL LOW caution light (both cockpits).
    * "WARNING, FUEL LOW" voice warning.
    * When ~1600 lbs total feed tank fuel remains.
    * Sensors exposed at <1000 lbs (right feed) or <600 lbs (left feed).
* Can activate with fuel in other tanks if transfer lags consumption.
* High transfer situations may inhibit cautions (fuel spray wetting sensors).
* Overrides:
    * STOP TRANS selections on fuel control panel.
    * Landing gear handle (allows external tank transfer).
    * Slipway switch for external tank pressurization/transfer.
* Does not activate tank 1 or CFT transfer pumps if slipway switch is OPEN or ORIDE.

#### Fuel Hot

* FUEL HOT caution on MPD/MPCD.
* Indicates engine feed fuel temperature too high.
* Recirculation to wings failed to reduce temperature.
* Action: Advance throttles to higher power setting (not AB) for higher fuel flow.
* If persists >5 minutes on ground, abort mission.

#### Transfer Malfunctions

##### External Tanks

* Transfer continues with electrical power loss (no pumps involved).
* Engine bleed air shutoff traps remaining fuel (insufficient ram air pressure for transfer).
* Potential signs of malfunction:
    * Other tanks transferring before externals empty.
    * Significant imbalance between wing externals.
* No cautions appear.
* Trapped fuel remains unavailable.
* Landing with one full/one empty external wing tank typically not problematic.
* Consider jettison if CG/flight control issues warrant.

##### Internal Transfer Tanks and/or CFTs

* "Warning, Transfer Pump" voice warning.
* "XFER Pump" MPD/MPCD caution.
* Primary detection: Fuel quantity gauge readings.
* Monitor transferring tanks to catch malfunctions early.
* Refer to checklist for specific procedures.
* No caution/warning for tank 1 transfer pump failure (monitor quantity to detect).

#### Emergency Transfer

Each transfer tank has backup capabilities:

##### Emergency Fuel Transfer/Dump (External Tanks), Gear Down

* Not a malfunction, but may be part of an emergency procedure.
* Normal transfer/dump impossible with gear handle down (no bleed air pressure).
* Procedure:
    1. Pull emergency gear handle to keep gear down.
    2. Raise normal landing gear handle.
    3. Pressurizes external tanks while keeping gear extended.

##### CFTs

* Pump failure indicated by "WARNING, TRANSFER PUMP" and XFER PUMP caution.
* Cycle CFT transfer switch to STOP TRANS to confirm CFT problem (caution should extinguish).
* If caution remains, indicates internal wing transfer pump issue.
* Use fuel gauge to determine specific problem.
* Each CFT has two pumps:
    * One pump failure: Decreased transfer rate.
    * Both pumps failure: Fuel trapped in tank.

##### Emergency TransferâCFT

* Three-position switch (CONF TANK EMERG TRANS).
* Only functional without main generator power.
* Normal position: NORM (center).
* L/R positions:
    * Power left/right CFT center transfer pump (emergency generator).
    * Turn off all aircraft pitot heaters (to limit emergency generator load).
* Procedure:
    1. Deplete internal fuel to ~1000 lbs below full.
    2. Alternately fill internal tanks from left/right CFTs.
* Caution: With gear down, fuel may transfer between CFTs rather than to internal tanks.

##### Internal Wing Tanks

* Failure indications:
    * "WARNING, TRANSFER PUMP" voice warning.
    * XFER PUMP MPD/MPCD caution.
* Cycle CFT transfer switch to STOP TRANS to confirm internal wing pump failure (caution remains on).
* Use fuel gauge to identify the problem.
* Substantially more fuel in one internal wing than the other (or more than in tank 1) confirms internal wing pump failure.
* Fuel will eventually gravity transfer.
* Significant lateral imbalance possible (up to 3300 pounds) before gravity transfer occurs.

##### Internal Transfer Tanks

* Pump failure (tank 1 or internal wing) results in delayed gravity transfer.
* Gravity transfer occurs only after other transfer tanks are empty.
* Flow rate depends on fuel level differences between tanks.
* To aid tank 1 gravity transfer: Maintain 3Â° to 7Â° nose-up pitch.
* Reduced transfer rate may be insufficient for high engine demand.
* With no transfer pumps operating (e.g., double main generator failure), maximum gravity transfer rate is 3500 PPH per engine.

##### Tank 1

* Probable failure if tank 1 quantity is >750 pounds (550 +200) higher than internal wing quantities.
* No cautions appear.
* AOA restricted to 30 units.
* Fuel usable but only gravity transfers after internal wing tanks are empty.

#### Lateral Tank Imbalances

* CFTs: Normal max imbalance â¤500 lbs. Sustained imbalance â¥1000 lbs for >5 minutes requires write-up.
* Internal wing tanks: Sustained imbalance â¥200 lbs for >5 minutes requires write-up.
* Total asymmetry (internal wings + CFTs) >600 lbs restricts AOA to 30 units.

#### Boost Pump Malfunctions

##### Single Boost Pump Failure

* Indications:
    * L BST PUMP or R BST PUMP caution on MPD/MPCD.
    * EMER BST ON caution on MPD/MPCD and caution panel (FCP only).
* Cause: Main boost pump (left or right) failed or insufficient pressure.
* EMER BST ON indicates emergency boost pump activation (powered by emergency generator).
* Two boost pumps still providing pressurized fuel to engines.
* Action: Do not use afterburner, land as soon as practical.

##### Double Boost Pump Failure

* Indications:
    * L BST PUMP and R BST PUMP cautions together, or
    * Either L/R BST PUMP with BST SYS MAL caution (no EMER BST ON).
* First case: EMER BST ON indicates emergency boost pump working.
* Second case: BST SYS MAL without EMER BST ON indicates emergency boost pump failure/insufficient pressure.
* One pump (main or emergency) still boosting fuel to engines.
* Should support all non-afterburner power settings below 30,000 feet.
* Refer to checklist for procedure.

##### Total Boost Pump Failure

* Indications: L BST PUMP, R BST PUMP, and BST SYS MAL cautions.
* Engines "sucking" fuel from feed tanks.
* High probability of one/both engines flaming out.
* Action:
    * Descend to minimum practical altitude.
    * Use maximum practical power (non-afterburner) on at least one engine.
    * Refer to checklist for procedures.
