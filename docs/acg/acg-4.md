### Electrical System Components

The F-15E electrical power system consists of:

* Two main AC generators
* Three transformer rectifiers (TRs)
* A hydraulically driven emergency generator
* A power distribution (bus) system

#### Main Generators

* Driven by the Airframe Mounted Accessory Drive (AMAD)
* Produce 115 volt AC power
* Each powers its own separate AC/DC bus during normal operation
* Each capable of supplying all basic aircraft electrical requirements
* Automatic load transfer if a fault is detected in one system

#### Transformer Rectifiers (TRs)

* Convert AC power from main generators to 28 volt DC power for DC buses
* Three TRs: Left, Right, and Essential

#### Emergency Generator

* Automatically activates when one or both main generators fail
* Can power systems necessary for safe recovery

#### Bus System

Distributes power to aircraft electrical systems

### Circuit Breakers

* Front cockpit circuit breakers located on the instrument panel, lower center
* Control power to:
    * Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS)
    * Pitot heat
    * Speed brake
    * Flaps
    * Landing gear
    * Nose gear steering
* Two additional circuit breaker panels in the rear cockpit (above right and left consoles)

### JFS Generator

The Jet Fuel Starter (JFS) generator provides power for:

* JFS ignition and control
* Intercom system (cockpit & ground crew chief)
* Front cockpit utility light
* AMAD fire warning/extinguisher system
* JFS ready light

The JFS READY light indicates when the JFS is up to speed and systems are available.

### Emergency Generator

* Driven by the utility hydraulic system
* Provides emergency AC/DC power during electrical system failure and initial engine start
* Separate from the primary system
* Activates when engine reaches 15-17% RPM (within 30 seconds after raising the finger lift)

### AC Generators

* Two main AC generators mounted on right and left AMADs
* Constant Speed Drive (CSD) maintains frequency control
* Each independently supplies power to certain aircraft AC buses
* Crossover system allows one generator to power both if the other fails

#### Current Limiters

* Protect each generator circuit
* Prevent a fault in one generator from damaging the other or causing both to shut down
* Prevent overloads on the remaining generator during single generator operation

#### Generator Control Switch

* Two-position (OFF and ON) lever-lock switches
* Located on the engine control panel
* Can disconnect a generator from its buses at any time

#### Generator Control Unit (GCU)

* Protects each generator against voltage, frequency, and mechanical failure damage
* Disconnects the generator from its buses if a fault occurs
* Transfers electrical load to the other main generator
* Attempts to reset the generator automatically for under-frequency conditions

### DC Power

* TRs convert AC power to DC power for DC buses
* Left and right TRs have a protection system (TRCU) similar to the AC system
* Essential TR operates independently
* No cockpit warning for single TR failure
* Emergency generator only activates when both main TRs fail

### External Power

* Connected through a receptacle near the nose gear wheelwell
* Used mainly by ground crew during maintenance
* Can be used for external power starts (rare)
* Energizes aircraft buses similar to an operating main generator (with some exceptions)

### Aircraft Lighting System

#### Exterior Lights

* Landing/taxi lights
* Anticollision lights
* Position lights
* Formation lights
* Vertical tail flood lights
* Slipway lights
* Air refueling receptacle flood light

#### Interior Lights

* Instrument lighting
* Console lighting
* Storm/flood lighting
* Standby compass light
* UFC lighting
* Chart light
* Display lighting
* Lights test switch
* Warning/caution lights control knob
* Utility flood lights

### Malfunctions, Warnings & Cautions

* Emergency generator operation/failure
* Main generator failure
* Transformer rectifier(s) failure
* Complete electrical system failure
* Smoke, fumes, or fire in cockpit (electrical)
* AMAD failure
