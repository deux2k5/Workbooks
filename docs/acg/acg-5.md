### Environmental Control System (ECS)

#### ECS Description

The ECS provides conditioned air and pressurization for the cockpit, avionics, windshield anti-fog, anti-ice, anti-G, canopy seal, and the fuel system. The system uses extracted air (bleed air) from both engines for normal operations. This high-pressure air from the 13th stage of the engine compressor is extremely hot but is conditioned through various components to deliver appropriate air to the various systems.

Key points:
- Either engine can provide enough air to operate the ECS
- Ram air cooling is available if normal ECS fails
- If ECS cooling air fails and the air source knob or cockpit temperature switch is placed to OFF, ram air is automatically provided to cool the avionics

#### ECS Components and Operation

1. Primary heat exchanger: Initially cools bleed air from ~1000째F to ~200째F
2. Compressor: Compresses the air
3. Secondary heat exchanger: Further cools the air
4. High pressure water separator (HPWS): Removes moisture using a cyclone effect
5. Cooling turbine: Rapidly expands the air, further dropping the temperature

Some systems branch off after the primary heat exchanger:
- Fuel pressurization (with its own additional heat exchanger)
- Windshield anti-ice
- Canopy seal

#### ECS-Cooled Systems

- Cockpit air vents
- Windshield anti-fog
- Multipurpose displays (MPDs/MPCDs)
- Upfront controls
- Forward avionics bays (left and right)
- Internal countermeasures set
- Radar waveguides
- Radar warning receiver
- Signal data recorder

#### ECS-Heated Systems

- Windshield anti-ice
- Anti-G
- Canopy seal
- Fuel pressurization

### ECS Controls

Located in the front cockpit on the forward part of the right console.

#### Cabin Temperature Control Switch/Knob

Three positions:
1. AUTO: Temperature control knob functions as a thermostat
2. MANUAL: Knob functions as a mixing valve
3. OFF: Stops ECS air to the cockpit, shuts off cooling turbine, opens ram air diverter valve for avionics cooling

#### Air Source Knob

Selects the engine bleed air source for the ECS:
- BOTH: Normal operation, both engines provide bleed air
- L ENG: Left engine only
- R ENG: Right engine only
- OFF: Closes both bleed air valves, shuts off cooling turbine, opens ram air diverter valve

#### Air Flow Selector Switch

Controls the volume of air flowing into the cockpit:
- MAX: Maximum air flow
- NORM: Normal air flow
- MIN: Minimum air flow

#### Air Vents

Adjustable vents in both cockpits:
- One large vent on the lower portion of the center console
- Two vents on each side of the canopy rail

#### Emergency Vent Handle

Located to the right of the FCP caution lights panel:
- 45째 CCW rotation electrically dumps cabin pressure
- Initial extension closes cabin inlet modulating valve and opens cockpit ram air valve
- Pulling the handle automatically selects anti-fog hot air

### Cockpit Pressurization System

- Automatically schedules pressurization when the canopy is closed and locked (engines running)
- Below ~FL240, the cockpit is pressurized at 8000 feet
- Above FL240, the cockpit altitude climbs at a 5 psi differential

### Associated Systems

#### Windshield Anti-Fog System

- Anti-fog air supplied whenever cockpit air conditioning is operating
- Anti-fog switch allows pilot to vary anti-fog air temperature

#### Windshield Anti-Ice System

- Controls hot airflow from the primary heat exchanger to the windshield exterior anti-ice air nozzle
- Use only when necessary to prevent windshield damage

#### Engine Anti-Ice/Heat System

- Ice detector in the left inlet duct
- Uses 13th stage bleed air to prevent icing on the front of the engine
- Automatically shuts off under certain conditions (e.g., altitude above 30,000 feet, inlet temperature above 60째F)

#### Anti-G System

- Automatic system delivering airflow to G-suits proportional to G forces
- Manual inflation button for system checks

### Pitot Static System

- Multiple pitot and static sources for redundancy
- Provides total and static air pressure to various aircraft systems
- Pitot heat switch controls heating elements of all four pitot static probes

### Oxygen Generating System

#### Molecular Sieve Oxygen Generating System (MSOGS)

- Uses ECS cooled bleed air, filtering out nitrogen and other pollutants
- Provides oxygen-enriched breathing gas
- Includes a self-charging backup oxygen system (BOS)

#### COMBAT EDGE System

- Enhances aircrew tolerance to G forces
- Operates in normal flight and pressure breathing for G (PBG) modes

### Canopy System

- Large clamshell canopy
- Hydraulic actuator for raising/lowering
- Hydraulic accumulator allows ~3 cycles without hydraulic power
- Pyrotechnic system for emergency canopy jettison

#### Canopy Controls

- Internal canopy control handles in front and rear cockpits
- External canopy control handle on left fuselage
- Emergency canopy jettison handles in each cockpit

### Boarding Steps

- Flush-mounted release button below and in front of the left intake
- Toe-actuated step release button for cockpit egress
- Steps stow by pushing up on the bottom step until it locks
