auto acq switch. This selects CDIP GUN and the HUD data block
displays the legend GUN. There is no RDY on the armament display, and
master arm switch to ARM is not required for the GUN legend. The only
head-up display indication of the master arm switch in ARM is the
presence of the gun cross. The reticle has no DIL attached (Figure D-3).

Rounds remaining, the current ranging source, and the analog bar/slant

MANUAL GUN

The MANUAL GUN mode for A/G strafe provides a backup capability
(aiming reference) when the CC or PACS has failed or the CDIP reticle is
not functioning properly. The following switches and actions are required.

A/G Master Mode: The A/G master mode enables the bombing circuitry
and must be selected to obtain an A/G sight. (Selecting a MANUAL
position with the selective jettison knob automatically selects the A/G
master mode).

Selective Jettison Knob: To obtain a fixed depressible sight for A/G strafe,
select MANUAL delivery mode (MAN FF or MAN RET) on the ACP, with
either SRM or MRM selected on the weapons select switch (not GUNS).

FCP MPCD: When the selective jettison knob is moved to a manual
release mode, the FCP MPCD reverts to a manual PACS display

(Figure D-4). The previously selected gun rate of fire is used. The PACS
selected bullet type is of no consideration.

available, it will be measured along the pipper LOS and presented as a
reticle range/analog bar. To achieve ranging, the pilot must be in

command of the HUD. With CC failure, neither AGR nor LASER range
will be available.

Strafe

Due to its upward cant, the gun system of the F-15E is not optimized for
A/G strafe. For a gun canted at or below the velocity vector, the pipper
moves toward the velocity vector from below as range decreases. For a
gun canted above the velocity vector, the pipper moves toward the velocity
vector from below only at very long range. At employment range, the
pipper moves above and away from the velocity vector. Finally, at shorter
ranges, the pipper moves toward the velocity vector from above

(Figure D-8). At effective strafe ranges, the velocity vector is short of the
target. This situation can result in very low pullouts. The more shallow
the dive angle, the more severe the problem. Strafe angles of less than
about 15° are uncomfortable.

AGD-06-08

Figure D - 8. Pipper Versus Flight Path.

Approach

The target may be approached from virtually any altitude or heading. It
is not necessary to designate the target but a TD diamond and command
heading may help in locating an obscure target. You must fly the airplane
to a position from which you can achieve your planned dive angle with
your velocity vector short of the target at the aim-off distance (Figure D-9)
and the pipper above the velocity vector (Figure D-10).

Tracking and Firing

As you close on the target with the velocity vector held on the aim-off
point, the pipper moves up toward the target. As the pipper reaches the
target, hold it there momentarily and squeeze the trigger. Continue to
hold the pipper on the target while firing (Figure D-11). For consistent
results, maintain planned airspeed and fire at the appropriate range. If
the rudder is used while strafing, the bullets will move approximately 80%
of the rudder input. Firing ranges for 30° strafe are approximately
7000-8000 feet slant range, and approximately 8000-9000 feet for 20°
strafe. Long slant ranges like these are not very effective for 20 mm.
These ranges are based on the M56 bullet. For weapons effect, PGU-28
will move the ranges out 300-500 feet.

Figure D - 11. CDIP GUN Firing (High Angle Strafe).

Frag patterns and ricochet patterns are directly affected by the type of
target. Harder surfaces produce more ricochets, while explosive targets
can produce huge frag patterns. The bullet ricochet pattern to be avoided
is a 500 foot diameter bubble and a +30° cone at 12 o’clock to the target.
The chances of a bullet ricochet hitting your jet go up as you fly 12 o’clock
to the target.

D-11 AGD-6


Text from AGD-6_Strafe_and_Noncomputed_Modes_page_18.jpeg:
Egress/Reattack

A good aggressive pulloff (5 Gs in 2 seconds) is required to avoid bullet
ricochets. It is important to pull the nose well above the horizon (20°)
even if you intend to egress at low altitude. Once you have cleared the
ricochet area you can return to low altitude. If a reattack is required,
steering is available if the target had been designated. Squeezing the
trigger does not designate a target.

Malfunctions
Failure to Fire

Check the master arm switch and RCP circuit breakers (Gun Trigger
Power, Last Round Power, Master Arm Logic Power). Check that A/G
CMBT and A/A CMBT are selected on the PACS.

Runaway Gun

In the event of uncommanded firing or failure to stop firing, point the gun
in the safest direction while turning off the master arm switch. Safe the
gun and do not attempt to fire the gun again.

Jammed Gun

WARNING

Unscheduled gun stoppage during firing
constitutes a possible hazardous condition
and is cause to terminate gun operation
for remainder of the flight. Stoppages can
be caused by malfunctions such as
rupture of round cartridge cases and
consequent dispersal of gun powder in the
gun compartment. Further operation of
the gun after a stoppage could make a
hazardous condition worse or cause a
minor problem to develop into a
hazardous condition.

AGD-6 D-12


Text from AGD-6_Strafe_and_Noncomputed_Modes_page_19.jpeg:
PACS/Mux Bus Failure

If the BIT page reveals a PACS mux bus code; i.e., PACS 2A, attempt to
clear by a CC mux bus clear (from the BIT MAINT AUDIT display), PACS
recycle and/or CC reset. An uncleared mux bus fault may inhibit selecting
an A/G CDIP GUN sight.

Will Not Safe

With the master arm in SAFE, if the HUD displays rounds remaining,
rather than XXX and/or a gun cross, assume the gun is armed. Do not
turn the master arm switch to ARM unless planning to fire the gun. Pull
the previously mentioned RCP circuit breakers and select A/A TRNG and
A/G TRNG on the PACS. Obviously, avoid the FCP trigger.

WARNING

If the HUD gun cross remains visible
after selecting master arm SAFE, the
weapon release button and trigger
circuits are ARMED.

NONCOMPUTED DELIVERY MODES

You will not often have the opportunity or the desire to use the
noncomputed bombing modes in the F-15E. The computed system
reliability is such that failure of the computed modes is rare. Further,
with the exception of PACS or CC failure, most failures which would
compromise the computed modes will also negate the manual modes.

The noncomputed modes available to you for bomb delivery are DIRECT
and MANUAL. When these modes are employed, the central computer is
not used to generate and display a bombing solution. These noncomputed
modes are backup modes, not alternate modes; they are incorporated to
provide a means for you to release armed munitions in the event you
suffer a PACS and/or CC failure in, or approaching, the target area. The
DIRECT mode provides the capability to practice “manual” bombing using
a SUU-20.

DIRECT

The primary function of the DIRECT mode is to remove the CC generated
ballistics from the bombing solution, so that you can practice “manual
bombing.” The reticle is commanded to be displayed in a fixed position as
set on the program page of the A/G delivery display. Bomb release occurs
as soon as the pickle button is depressed. The pilot must achieve
preplanned parameters associated with the mil setting for a valid solution
to exist. This mode is available only with the SUU-20 bomb dispenser or
GBU-24/28 selected on the PACS.

Required Equipment

In order to have the DIRECT mode available, the following equipment
must be functional: CC, MPDP, PACS, and at least one MPD/MPCD. To
be able to achieve parameters, the HUD, ADC/ADP and INS or EGI must
also be functional.

Although the CC does not generate the bombing solution, it commands the
reticle to be displayed at the entered depression angle. The reticle is
created within the MPDP and displayed on the HUD. In short, it takes a
lot of equipment just to have a reticle as an aiming device.

An MPD/MPCD is required to program the PACS for a direct delivery and
to select ordnance and release sequencing.

D-17 AGD-6


Text from AGD-6_Strafe_and_Noncomputed_Modes_page_24.jpeg:
Required delivery parameters include airspeed, altitude, angle of attack,
and delivery angle. The ADC/ADP is needed to have accurate airspeed
and altitude information. The INS/EGI is your source of attitude
information.

So, if all the above mentioned equipment is working, you have an aiming
device, a way to select the DIRECT mode, and a way to determine delivery

parameters.

Switches/Controls

The following is a look at the switches and actions involved in setting up
the DIRECT mode.

A/G Master Mode: The A/G master mode enables the bombing circuitry
and must be selected to release air-to-ground ordnance in any delivery
mode.

MPD/MPCD: You must use an MPD/MPCD to program the PACS. You
must set up a DIRECT program (SUU-20 or GBU-24/28 only) to include
ordnance stations and desired release sequencing.

A/G Delivery Display: Mils can be input only through the A/G delivery
display, adjacent to PB #2. To change the mil setting, enter the desired
value (0 to 250) into the UFC scratchpad and depress PB #2. The new
value is sent to the CC.

Master Arm Switch: The master arm must be placed to ARM to enable
the release circuits and obtain a PACS RDY.

Pickle Button: The last step to initiate a release is to depress the pickle
button on either cockpit control stick.

Release Programming

Full PACS capability must exist to have DIRECT available. Establish a
DIRECT program. For the SUU-20 only, if DIRECT is selected, the STEP
release sequence is automatically selected. 1/STA, RPL SGL and RPL
MPL are unavailable if DIRECT is selected with a SUU-20.

AGD-6 D-18


Text from AGD-6_Strafe_and_Noncomputed_Modes_page_25.jpeg:
Displays

To use the DIRECT bombing mode, you need an armament display on an
MPD/MPCD, the UFC, and the HUD.

Armament: You can bring up an ARMT display (Figure D-12) on any
MPD/MPCD. You must have a DIRECT program selected with at least
one SUU-20, GBU-24, or GBU-28 loaded station boxed. If the pilot is in
command of the HUD during GBU-24/28 operations, pulling aft on the
auto acq switch cycles between AUTO and DIRECT delivery modes. You
must also have a RDY indication next to PB #11 which indicates the
master arm is in ARM and the PACS is ready.

HUD: The HUD (Figure D-14) displays the reticle at the selected
depression angle. This is an “iron” sight and does not move on the HUD;
it is just like any other fixed depressible sight you may have used.
“DIRECT” appears in the lower right corner of the HUD if it is the
selected mode and only if the PACS is ready. Presence of the gun cross is
a further indication the master arm is in ARM. Since the CC is required
to obtain the DIRECT mode, many of the features available in the
computed modes are available—a designated target, LASER ranging, or
AGR, for example. Pickling in DIRECT does not designate the target like
it does in CDIP or undesignated AUTO. However, since the DIRECT
mode simulates using the MANUAL mode with combat ordnance, for a
true simulation you may not want to use features not available when
MANUAL was required because of avionics failures.

Text from AGD-6_Strafe_and_Noncomputed_Modes_page_28.jpeg:
MANUAL

The primary function of the MANUAL modes is to bypass a failed CC or
PACS. It uses hardwired circuits to the weapons stations. The CC’s
ballistic computations are removed from the bombing solution. The mode
essentially provides a way to release armed ordnance in the event of a
major failure. The reticle is displayed at the depression set on the UFC.
Bomb release occurs as soon as the pickle button is depressed. The pilot
must achieve preplanned parameters associated with the mil setting for a
valid solution to exist. This mode cannot be used to release bombs from a
SUU-20 since the release pulse is sent to the BRU-47 breeches, rather
than the SUU-20. If the BRU-47 was carted (it normally is not with a
SUU-20 loaded), a release pulse would release the SUU-20.

Required Equipment

To enter the MANUAL mode requires only that the selective jettison knob
be rotated to a manual release mode. However, to have a reticle, the
MPDP and HUD must be functional. To be able to achieve parameters,
the ADC/ADP and INS or EGI must also be functional. The UFC is
required to set the mils (assuming you are using MANUAL because the
CC has failed).

Just as in the DIRECT mode, the reticle is displayed at the entered

depression angle. The reticle is created in the MPDP and displayed on the
HUD.

To determine airspeed, altitude, and attitude for release, you need the
ADC/ADP and the INS or EGI.

If the above equipment is functional, you have a way to select the mode,
aim the bomb, and determine delivery parameters.

Switches/Controls

Next is a look at the switches and actions required to set up the MANUAL
mode.

Selective Jettison Knob: This knob, located on the armament control

panel, is rotated to either MAN RET or MAN FF to select the MANUAL
mode.

AGD-6 D - 22


Text from AGD-6_Strafe_and_Noncomputed_Modes_page_29.jpeg:
A/G Master Mode: The A/G master mode enables the bombing circuitry
and must be selected to release ordnance in any delivery mode. With CC

failure, selectable master modes are unavailable, but selection of
MANUAL also selects the A/G master mode.

FCP MPCD: When the selective jettison knob is moved to one of the MAN
release modes, the FCP MPCD reverts to a MANUAL PACS display and
the top row of pushbuttons (PBs #16-20) are activated. These PBs are
used to select weapons loaded stations.

UFC: With an operative CC, mils can be set on the A/G delivery display
adjacent to PB #2. To change the mil setting, enter the desired value (0 to
250) into the scratchpad and depress PB #2. The new value is shown on
the display and sent to the CC. If the CC fails, the sight depression angle
defaults to 0 mils and the reticle depression angle can be entered on the
UFC backup Menu 2. (The A/G delivery display is unavailable with CC
failure).

Master Arm Switch: The master arm must be placed to ARM to enable
the release circuits.

Pickle Button: To initiate a release, depress and hold the pickle button on
either cockpit control stick. With no way to program the number of bombs
to be released or to monitor the number of bombs actually released, the
pickle button must be held long enough to ensure all selected stations
empty.

Release Programming

Only limited release programming is available in the MANUAL mode and
is obtained by selection of MAN RET or MAN FF.

MAN RET: Weapons stations are as selected on the FCP MPCD. Only
the tail fuze solenoid is activated. Bombs are released in a ripple multiple
mode with one bomb being released from each selected station
simultaneously, until all bombs are released (or the pickle button is
released). The release interval is fixed at a range of 200 to 260 ms (230
Ms nominal).

MAN FF: Weapons stations are as selected on the FCP MPCD. Only the
nose and center fuze solenoids are activated. Bombs are released in a
ripple multiple mode with one bomb being released from each selected
station simultaneously, until all bombs are released (or the pickle button
is released). The release interval is fixed at a range of 60 to 80 ms (70 ms
nominal).

NOTE

If CBU type ordnance is loaded, MAN FF must be selected to get an
armed weapon for canister opening (there is no way to get nose and tail
arming in MANUAL). This will cause the fuzes to function on time

which may result in earlier than desired canister openings. Also,
ripple intervals may be below the minimum interval required in
Section V of the Dash 1.

Displays

If the UFC is inoperative with CC failure, weapons can still be released,
but the “iron sight” in the HUD will be displayed at zero setting (with CC
failure, the mil setting defaults to zero). If the HUD is inoperative, no
head-up display will be available, although a HUD repeater may be
available on an MPD/MPCD (not available with CC failure).

Armament: The FCP MPCD automatically reverts toa MANUAL PACS
display (Figure D-15) when the selective jettison knob is rotated to a MAN
position. The display has the word “MANUAL” printed in the center. The
top row of PBs is usable to select weapons stations even if the display
itself is not working. These PBs are internally lighted and are lit if a
station is selected. The FCP MPCD is frozen while in MANUAL and
cannot be changed until the SEL JETT knob is rotated out of the MAN
mode.

Text from AGD-6_Strafe_and_Noncomputed_Modes_page_32.jpeg:
If any other MPD/MPCD has an ARMT display up when the SEL JETT
knob is rotated to a manual release mode, the display reverts to the basic
display menu and the ARMT option at PB #2 is removed. Since the
ARMIT option is deleted from the display menu, no MPD/MPCD other than
the FCP MPCD can display ARMT information while the SEL JETT knob
is in MAN.

A/G Delivery Display: To check or set sight depression mils (CC
operative), you must be on the A/G delivery display. The currently
selected mil setting is next to PB #2. Use a transfer from the UFC
scratchpad to set the mils.

If the CC fails, the MPDP is used as a backup to provide a UFC. The
sight depression angle defaults to 0 mils, and the reticle depression angle
can be entered on the UFC backup Menu 2 (Figure D-16).

HUD: The HUD (Figure D-17) displays the reticle at the selected

any depressible sight you may have used in the past. The legend
“MANUAL?” appears in the lower right corner of the HUD as soon as the
SEL JETT knob is rotated to a manual release mode. Since this mode
essentially goes around the PACS, the PACS is not checked for a ready
condition and the master arm does not have to be in ARM to get the
legend. There is no pullup (for lofts) cue in MANUAL. If you are using
MANUAL because the CC is inoperative (the normal reason), there is a
gun cross with the master arm in ARM. Ifthe CC is operative but the
PACS is failed, a gun cross may or may not be displayed, depending on the
failure.

TEXT
A/G GUN

The M61A1 gun description and functions are covered in the air-to-air
weapons block of instruction. Preflight procedures for a hot gun are
contained in TO 1F-15E-34-1-1CL-1.

Modes

There are two A/G gun modes: CDIP GUN and MANUAL. With CDIP
GUN selected, the pilot has a computer driven CDIP reticle. The
MANUAL GUN mode, selected from the FCP armament control panel
(ACP), provides a fixed depressible sight, with a manually set reticle
depression. AGR/LAS ranging may be used in either mode, if available.

The A/A gun mode is only marginally useful in A/G strafe. The A/A gun
attack steering only computes a crosswind correction. The wind-corrected
attack steering is only valid when the pipper is stabilized on the target
with the ball centered. Without a lock on, the CC uses a 2250-foot range
and a 50 fps range rate in lead angle computation. Also, in the A/A mode,
A/G slant range (AGR or LAS) presentation is not available.

NOTE

The gun is “hot” in flight in all master modes (A/A, A/G, NAV, INST)
anytime the master arm switch is in ARM (gun cross ON), assuming

the gun is electrically/mechanically armed and both A/A CMBT and
A/G CMBT are selected on the PACS.

Although the gun will not fire unless both A/A and A/G PACS are in the
combat mode (TO 1F-15E-34-1-1), the same document makes several
disclaimers concerning use of the TRNG PACS as a SAFE mode including
that circuit failures can occur which would allow weapon release, even
with TRNG selected. Do not use the A/A and/or A/G TRNG PACS
selection as a gun safing feature.

Switches and Controls
CDIP GUN
The following switches and actions are required to use CDIP GUN.

A/G Master Mode: The A/G master mode is required to obtain an A/G
sight.

Armament: To employ CDIP GUN you need a CDIP PACS program with
no stations selected. Call up any existing CDIP program and unbox all
the stations. The PACS RDY at PB #11 goes away (Figure D-1). Then,
while in command of the HUD, pull aft on the FCP auto acq switch. This
selects CDIP GUN. If you drop all the bombs on the selected stations
during a CDIP pass, you have effectively unboxed all stations making
CDIP GUN HOTASable. (This includes when the PACS believes the
SUU-20 to be empty and unboxes the station).

Two types of bullets are available for the F-15E. The type and quantity of
bullets are entered on the A/A weapons load page. On all PACS display
formats where rounds count is shown, the count is followed by a “P” for
PGU-28 or “M” for M56. The firing rate, LOW or HIGH, is set on the A/A
PACS employment display.

A/G Delivery Display Format: A minimum recovery altitude (MRA) can
be set on the A/G delivery display. Along track (AT)/cross track (CT)
corrections can be set on the program page of the A/G delivery display by
boxing “PROG PAGE.” LASER range or AGR is available if the AUTO
sensor hierarchy is selected or if LAS and/or AGR is included in the MAN
sensor hierarchy selection. Ranging information on the HUD requires
that the pilot be in command of the sensor (radar/AGR and/or TGT
pod/LAS) through HUD command.
