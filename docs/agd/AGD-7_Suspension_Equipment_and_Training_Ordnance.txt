Suspension Hooks

The suspension and release mechanism is composed of mechanical
linkages and sets of hooks. The hooks on the BRU-46/A are 14 inches
apart. The BRU-47/A is equipped with two sets of hooks. One set is 14
inches apart and the other set is 30 inches apart to accommodate the
larger stores. When a store is loaded, and each hook is locked, a hook
locked visual indicator (a white tab) for each hook is visible through a hole
in the rack. During store release, the mechanical linkages cause the
hooks to open simultaneously to ensure positive store release. The hook
store sensing switch senses whether the hooks are open or closed. When
they are closed, the BRU senses a store is loaded on that station and
relays that through the PACS.

Swaybraces

On each BRU, there are four swaybraces and wedges that provide store
stability during flight. Ensure these are engaged and contact the store
during the preflight.

Ejection Mechanism

Each BRU contains two cartridge breeches and two ejector pistons. When
the cartridges detonate, gas pressure opens the BRU hooks and forces the
ejector pistons down, ejecting the store (employment or jettison).

Arming Mechanism

Arming is provided by three arming units, often referred to as arming
solenoids. During loading, these solenoids accept the weapon fuze arming
wires. When a jettison is required, the arming units release the arming
wires at weapon release, causing ordnance to drop in a safe condition. For
an armed release, the solenoids retain the swivel links at release, pulling
the wire out of the fuze, allowing fuze arming. Arming selections are
made through the PACS. The nose selection activates the center and
forward arming solenoids; tail energizes the aft solenoid.

Pitch Valves

By ensuring BRU-46/A and BRU-47/A pitch valves are set IAW the
Dash 34 checklist (Figure D-4), the crew also ensures optimum separation
of stores (either through employment or jettison).

Ground Safety Handle

The ground safety handle (Figure D-5) is used to prevent inadvertent
opening of the hooks during ground operations. The ground safety handle
mechanically prevents the opening of the hooks and prevents electrical
current from reaching the impulse carts. In the safe position, the handle
is rotated to the vertical and pushed in. Reflective paint is visible on the
shaft when the handle is extended. The ground safety handle is moved
(rotated counterclockwise to the horizontal position) to the armed position
just prior to flight and pushed back in.

Reversible In-flight Locking (RIFL) Mechanism

The BRU-47/A has a RIFL mechanism. This is a safety and failsafe
provision that is designed to prevent inadvertent opening of the
suspension hooks and firing of the impulse cartridges when a nuclear
weapon is loaded. When the RIFL is in the locked position, the RIFL
locked visual indicator (a white tab) appears through a hole in the rack.
To release (jettison or employ) stores utilizing the conventional PACS, the
RIFL must be in the unlocked condition.

CFT Carriage/Release Sequence

CFT carriage utilizes two rows of BRUs which permit carriage of up to six
1000 pound class weapons or two 2000 pound class weapons or one
nuclear weapon on each CFT (Figure D-6). BRU-46/As are used in the
outboard (shoulder) row and BRU-47/As are used for the inboard (bottom)
row. The tandem carriage arrangement and the deletion of a requirement
for extra bomb racks reduces in-flight drag.

Jettison Procedures

Emergency Jettison (“Panic”) Button

The momentary contact emergency jettison button (Figure D-7), labeled
EMERG JETT, is hot anytime power (including external, main generator,
or emergency generator power) is on the aircraft. Emergency jettison is
operable with the landing gear handle down. The button must be held in
for approximately one second to complete a full load jettison sequence.
Depressing the button releases the carted SUU-59/SUU-73 pylons at
stations 2, 5, and 8, and the stores (bombs/missiles) from all carted CFT
stations. The LANTIRN pods beneath the intakes and the CFTs do not
have jettison capability.

Selective Jettison Knob/Button

The selective jettison knob is used to select one of several stores release
modes (Figure D-8). The SEL JETT modes are COMBAT, A/A, and A/G.
If the knob is rotated to COMBAT and the button depressed, jettison
occurs as preprogrammed through the PACS. When the knob is rotated to
A/G, all current armament displays and the FCP MPCD change to the A/G
JETTISON display from which desired stores or pylons can be selected for
jettison. If a store is aboard, the display initiates with STORE boxed and
PYLON may be selected (for stations 2, 5, and/or 8). RACK is only used to
jettison LAU-88 or LAU-117 Maverick launchers. Once the desired
stations are selected, depress and hold (until release complete) the button
in the center of the SELECT JETT knob to release all selected stores. All
PACS displays are frozen until the selective jettison knob is rotated out of
SEL JETT; i.e., A/A or A/G. Jettison using any of the selective jettison
capabilities requires main generator power and either the landing gear
handle must be up or the armament safety switch must be in the
OVERRIDE position.

WARNING

Each selection of the CBT JETT display
reinitializes the two-push sequence and
resets the first push of the selective
jettison button to the CBT 1 program,
even if the CBT 1 programmed racks,
stores or pylons have already been
jettisoned.

The combat jettison program is displayed
in TRNG and is reprogrammable for the
TRNG mode display. However, when
CBT JETT is performed, the system exits
TRNG mode and jettisons actual stores
loaded and programmed in the CMBT
mode.

TRAINING ORDNANCE

The F-15E is certified to carry a wide variety of air-to-surface ordnance
suspended from wing/centerline pylons and the CFTs. Throughout the
surface attack phase of your training in FTU, the standard training load
will be a SUU-20 dispenser (loaded with six BDU-33s) on each wing pylon.

SUU-20

The SUU-20 is a practice bomb and rocket dispenser. It can be carried on
the wing or centerline pylons. You need only concern yourself with the
bomb portion of the SUU-20. Rockets are not used in this program and
the intervalometer switch is removed. For a detailed description, refer to
TO 1-1M-34, Section V.

The dispenser has six bomb stations which can be loaded with BDU-33
and/or MK 106 practice bombs. The bombs loaded in the SUU-20 are
identified to the conventional PACS by selecting the proper SUU-20 PACS
ID from the PACS weapons list (Figure D-9, left). Selecting PACS ID
“SUU-20N” identifies a SUU-20 loaded with BDU-33s (blue bombs).
Selecting “SUU-20M” identifies a SUU-20 loaded with MK 106s (orange
bombs). With a mixed load, or in the nuclear PACS, you must select
“SUU-20”, and then identify each bomb in the dispenser (Figure D-9,
right). With the store identified as a SUU-20, the RPL SGL and RPL
MPL release sequencing options are not available. The MK 106 practice
bomb is no longer in the Air Force inventory; however, it is still one of the
options in the PACS.

Major features and preflight items of the SUU-20 dispenser are shown in
Figure D-10.

Bombs are held in place by the bomb retaining arms and stabilized by
swaybraces. Bombs are force ejected by electrically fired pyrotechnic
cartridges. Bomb release sequencing is controlled by an intervalometer
(rotary switch) in the nose of the dispenser. This intervalometer rotates
clockwise only and functions in a step-and-fire fashion. The stepper
switch stops at station 6 and cannot step from 6 to 1. The BOMB RIPPLE
and SALVO positions of the rotary switch are not used in the F-15E.

Figure D - 11. SUU-20 Release Sequence.

If a ripple release is desired, load SUU-20N in the PACS and then
program the PACS for a ripple release. Ripple release is not possible
using the SUU-20 PACS identity. Safing of the SUU-20 dispenser is
provided by several means. The intervalometer being in a SAFE position
electrically prevents carts from firing. A safety spring installed in the
lower rear of the dispenser breaks the aircraft-to-SUU electrical circuit.
Individual ejector gun safety pins prevent the retaining arms from
opening should a cart accidentally fire (during ground operations).

AGD-7 D-16


Text from AGD-7_Suspension_Equipment_and_Training_Ordnance_page_23.jpeg:
Preflight

Ensure the safety spring is installed in the rear of the SUU-20 dispenser
and an ejector gun safety pin is installed in each set of retaining arms.

Ensure the bomb intervalometer is in the SAFE position preceding bomb
single; this is toward the nose of the dispenser.

Ensure all bombs are securely in place.

Preflight procedures for all weapons are contained in TO 1F-15E-34-1-1
and TO 1F-15E-34-1-1CL-1.

When carrying the SUU-20 dispenser at FTU, neither the pylon nor the
BRU-47/A is carted. Therefore, the SUU-20 is not jettisonable. The pylon
safety pin is installed, however, and will be removed by the arming crew
in the arming area. The arming crew also sets the bomb intervalometer to
ARM, removes the retaining arm safety pins, and removes the safety
spring.

The BRU-47/A cartridge indicators are extended if carts are not present.
The pylon breech retainers are safety wired when no carts are installed.
Carts are not installed to prevent inadvertent jettison of the SUU-20.
Additionally, the safety handle should be vertical, which is the SAFE
position.

Ensure the RIFL is unlocked. If locked, the RIFL prevents release of
stores from the BRU-47/A (including bombs from the SUU-20) through the
conventional PACS. Ifthe RIFL is locked, the nuclear PACS must be
used.

Carriage/Kmployment Limits

Maximum allowable airspeed, Mach number, G, and AOA are reduced by
virtue of having a SUU-20 installed on the aircraft. If the PACS is
properly programmed, the OWS generated and displayed allowable G is
still correct for the basic aircraft structure. The OWS, however, is not
programmed with individual stores limits. You must remember these
limits and not exceed them. Check the Dash 1, Section V for the current
SUU-20 limits. E2mpty pylons are cleared to basic aircraft limits.

D-17 AGD-7


Text from AGD-7_Suspension_Equipment_and_Training_Ordnance_page_24.jpeg:
BDU-33

The BDU-33 (blue bomb) (Figure D-12) is a 24 pound practice bomb that is
used to simulate many different low drag bombs. The bomb normally
contains a signal cartridge about the size of a 10 gauge shotgun shell. The
cart is detonated by impact to provide flash and smoke for spotting/scoring
purposes. This flash is emitted from the tail of the bomb and is
potentially dangerous if the cart is ignited while you are close to the bomb.
During preflight checks, be careful not to push in on the nose plunger.

The safety device between the nose plunger and the bomb body prevents
bomb signal cartridge detonation if the bomb were to fall out of the
SUU-20 on the ground. The weapons load crew removes the safety device
in the chocks after uploading the BDU-33s in the SUU-20. There are also
“cold spot” bombs which emit smoke only (no flash). These bombs are
utilized when range conditions dictate precautions to prevent range fires.
Additionally, the tail fin assembly of the bomb is easily damaged. For a
more detailed description of the bomb, refer to TO 1-1M-34, Section V.

Preflight BDU-33s

Ensure the BDU-33s are secure in their retaining arms by visual
inspection. Do not hit the bombs’ nose firing pins!

Operating Limits

Carriage: BDU-33s loaded into a SUU-20 do not impose any carriage
restrictions over the empty SUU-20. Refer to the Dash 1, Section V for
the current limits.

Employment: Employment G limits are not incorporated into the OWS
program. Additionally, exceeding these limits does not generally inhibit a
release but may result in a bomb-aircraft collision or hung bomb. Current
limits are as shown in the Dash 1, Section V.

Jettison: Jettison of BDU-33s is not possible. If the bombs must be

jettisoned, they must be released normally via the PACS and the bomb
release buttons (pickle buttons).

MXU-648 Cargo Pods

The MXU-648 cargo pod (Figure D-13) is a modified BLU-1 or BLU-27
firebomb shell. Four different variants of MXU-648 cargo pods (A/A, B/A,
C/A, D/A) are currently in the inventory. Only the A/A is certified on the
F-15E (Table D-1). Each variant has three versions. Each is an
aluminum canister consisting of tapered nose and tail sections, and a
center section with a hinged access door. Some versions of the MXU-648

The F-15E is designed to deliver a vast array of conventional weapons. To
do this, there must be a method to attach these munitions to the aircraft
so they are secure until delivery or jettison is desired. The suspension
equipment is designed to provide these capabilities.

The aircraft carries external stores on stations 2, 5, and 8, and the right
and left conformal fuel tanks (CFTs) (Figure D-1). Prior to carrying any
external stores, ensure that you are familiar with the carriage,
employment, and jettison limits from TO 1F-15E-1, Section V, Operating
Limitations.

Pylons

The F-15E may be equipped with armament pylons on both wing stations
(#2 and #8), and the centerline station (#5). SUU-59 pylons are used on
the wing stations and the SUU-78 pylon is used on the centerline station.
These pylons (Figure D-2) contain a BRU-47/A and other hardware and
electrical wiring to provide the interface between the aircraft and
whatever is suspended from that pylon. The SUU-59 and SUU-73 are
functionally identical; they differ only in shape and size to fit the differing
aerodynamic and structural requirements of the stations they serve. To
permit jettison of the pylon with the stores, each pylon contains two
ejector cartridges, resembling shotgun shells. They provide the force
needed to separate the pylon from the aircraft. The pylons should be
checked each flight when you are carrying any store that may require
jettisoning (the pylons are not carted for most FTU training missions).
Also, ensure that the pylon ejector breech safety pin is installed. During
pylon jettisoning, the pylon is retained by the aft pivot point until an
initial nose-down pitch moment is obtained to ensure safe separation from
the aircraft.

Bomb Release Units (BRUs)

A bomb release unit is an integral part, actually the workhorse, of each
pylon and CFT station. The BRU-46/A is in the outboard CFT stations
and the BRU-47/A is in each pylon and inboard (lower) CFT station
(Figure D-3). These units contain the hardware for stores carriage,
employment and jettison, and tell the aircraft stores are on board. The
BRU-46/A carries stores in the 1000 pound class, while the BRU-47/A
carries the 2000 pound and up class weapons. The BRUs also have
cartridge breeches to provide for release or jettison of stores mounted to
its hooks. The breech caps have cartridge indicators which are flush if
carts are installed and extended if carts are not installed. The hooks are
mechanically locked and the breech carts electrically isolated by the safety
handle. This handle is permanently installed and can be rotated between
SAFE and ARM. Another item on the BRU-47/A is the reversible in-flight
lock (RIFL) which must be unlocked to allow release or jettison of stores
utilizing the conventional (vice nuclear) PACS, including release of bombs
from a SUU-20.
