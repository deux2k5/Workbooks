Text from AGR-4_Navigation_page_10.jpeg:
The UTM coordinates are entered as one number (meters) starting with
the east component and followed by the north. The east and north
components are entered in true direction (rather than magnetic direction).
In Figure D-2, the east component is 69,135 meters (true) and the north
component is 90,285 (true). Combining the components into a single
number, they are entered into the UTM submenu at PB #38 as
6913590285. UTM coordinates must be entered with an even number of
digits. If the components are not measured to the same magnitude,
leading zeros are added to the components to keep the number of
component digits the same. Additionally, trailing zeros need not be
entered as the system uses the first half of the digits as the east
component and the second half as the north component (e.g., to enter a
component of 64,120 meters east and 520 meters north of the block
identifier, enter 64120052). When entered, this will be displayed at PB #3
as 6412000520. The point elevation is entered at PB #7 and TOT at PB
#9,

Note that you would have to select the LAT/LONG point data submenu to
enter a minimum en route altitude (MEA). If the spheroid or grid zone
identifier must be changed, the UTM programming submenu is accessed
by pressing PB #8, PROGRAM. The asterisk following PROGRAM
indicates that you are in the UTM programming submenu. The spheroid
is changed by cycling PB #9 until the desired spheroid is displayed. The
grid zone identifier number is changed by typing the number into the
scratchpad and then pressing PB #2. The block identifier letters are
changed by pressing PB #2 (with a clear scratchpad) to move the caret to
the desired letter. Then, press PB #4 to increase or PB #7 to decrease
through the alphabet until the desired letter is displayed (the letters I and
O are not used). Numbers (UTM coordinates or the grid zone numbers)
can be entered (or changed) either on the UTM programming submenu or
the UTM submenu. Letters (spheroid or block identifier letters) can only
be entered (or changed) on the UTM programming submenu.

Programming RNG/BRG and DIR/RNG Data

The UFC RNG/BRG and DIR/RNG submenus (Figure D-5) allow the
aircrew to program sequence points using range and true (not magnetic)
bearing or directional (north/south, east/west—again in true) components
from known sequence points which are already in memory. The known
reference points (from which the RNG/BRG or DIR/RNG components are
applied to identify the geographical position of derived points) were
entered via DTM, list point, or manually utilizing LAT/LONG or UTM
coordinates. When a target is the known point, up to seven TGT offset
(O/S) points can be derived (Figure D-3). Likewise, there can be up to
seven aim points (AIM) derived from a known steer point.

However, if a TGT O/S (or aim point) is the known point, only one
associated TGT point (or steer point) may be derived (Figure D-3). In
either case, the known point may only be displayed in the UTM or
LAT/LONG format while the derived point data may be displayed using
UTM, LAT/LONG, RNG/BRG, or DIR/RNG formats. (Regardless of which
of the four formats is used to define the derived point, once entered, it can
be displayed in any of the four formats.)

Figure D - 4.

Referring to Figure D-4, TGT O/S 8.01A can be entered into the CC using
either range and bearing (RNG/BRG) or directional component and range
(DIR/RNG) from known TGT 8.A. The RNG/BRG and DIR/RNG formats
serve exactly the same purpose and either may be used. However,
DIR/RNG can be programmed more accurately (in feet) than can
RNG/BRG (in tenths of a nm).

In the example, TGT O/S 8.01A is 3.4 nm, bearing 076° true from TGT
8.A. In the same example, TGT O/S 8.01A is 20,156 feet true east and
4850 feet true north from TGT 8.A. TGT O/S 8.01A has an elevation at
1315 feet MSL.

AGR-4 D-6


Text from AGR-4_Navigation_page_13.jpeg:
RNG/BRG data is programmed by accessing the RNG/BRG point data
submenu. Figure D-5 (left) depicts a typical RNG/BRG format. To
program data, call up the correct TGT O/S point (i.e., 8.01A) by entering
the point identifier in the scratchpad, and pressing PB #1. Then enter the
range, bearing and elevation data. TOTs and MEAs cannot be entered for
offsets or aim points, only for targets and steer points. In the example,
enter 8.01A into PB #1, 3.4 into PB #2, 076 into PB #3, and 1315 into

PB #7. The data for PBs #2, #3 and #7 can be programmed into the UFC
in any order. Remember, the RNG/BRG submenu uses true versus
magnetic bearing, as do the DIR/RNG and UTM point data submenus.

Figure D - 5.

DIR/RNG components can be programmed in a similar manner by
accessing the DIR/RNG submenu. Start by pressing PB #4 in any point
data submenu until the DIR/RNG submenu is displayed (Figure D-5,
right). Then, enter the desired sequence point at PB #1, followed by the
directional components and point elevation in PBs #2, #3 and #7. For the
example in Figure D-4, you enter 8.01A at PB #1, N4850 feet at PB #2,
E20156 feet at PB #3, and 1315 at PB #7. The directional components
and elevation may be input in any order. Remember, the N/S and E/W
direction must be entered in true degrees from the known point (in this
case, TGT 8.A).

D-7 AGR-4


Text from AGR-4_Navigation_page_14.jpeg:
Once TGT O/S 8.01A is correctly programmed in the RNG/BRG or
DIR/RNG format, it may be displayed in any of the other formats by
pressing PB #4 to cycle to the desired format. When the aircrew
designates TGT O/S 8.01A from the A/G radar or TGT IR, the CC will
provide steering and computed weapons delivery (in A/G master mode) to
TGT 8.A. In later lessons you will learn about the various ways to
designate targets and the weapons employment steering/release cues that
are provided.

You are only able to access the RNG/BRG and DIR/RNG point data
submenus if a derived point syntax (vice a known point syntax) is at PB
#1 on a point data submenu. For example, if you identified target 7. first
(using LAT/LONG or UTMs), the RNG/BRG or DIR/RNG formats would
only be available with 7.01 through 7.07 showing at PB #1. If you enter
the offset first, say 7.01, (using LAT/LONG or UTM's) the RNG/BRG or
DIR/RNG formats are available only with the corresponding target, 7., at
PB #1. The same logic applies to steer points and their associated aim
points.

Data Verification

Before departing on the mission, check sequence point data accuracy. One
technique is to make a list during preflight planning of magnetic bearings
and ranges from the parking ramp to the sequence points defining the
planned route. Unfortunately, the Air Force Mission Support System
(AFMSS) cannot compute this information in the current C3.0 release.
After defining the sequence points, either by data transfer module (DTM)
or UFC, access the UFC Data 1 display (Figure D-6) and compare the
bearing/range displayed at PB #1 to the listed bearings/ranges. By
entering each point you are able to confirm the accuracy of the sequence
point coordinates (commonly called a swing check).

AGR-4 D-8


Text from AGR-4_Navigation_page_15.jpeg:
Figure D-6 shows a list of sequence points, the bearing and range to each
point, and the Data 1 display, with STR 2A as the current aircraft

sequence point. By comparing the bearing and range at PB #1 to the list,
the geographical accuracy of STR 2A programmed coordinates is verified.

If desired, the HUD information and/or HSI/TEWS NAV data blocks can
be used for this check. (Bearings on the Data 1/Data 2 UFC pages, and
steering on the HUD/ADI and HSI/TEWS are magnetic bearings.) If there
are significant discrepancies between planned and programmed data,
recheck the inputs. You can also verify the point data programming by
stepping through the points on the TSD. Check that all points are
overlaid at the correct location on the moving map, and in the proper
sequence. Compare the “big picture” as shown on the mission charts to
the shape of the route displayed on the TSD.

The above techniques allow you to verify the geographical accuracy for
each sequence point. However, point elevation, MEA and TOT
information are important and should be verified on a UFC point data
submenu.

Last Minute Route/Timing Changes—Programming the New Route
The navigation system accommodates last minute route and/or timing
changes. Suppose that before takeoff the command post calls and changes

the route. The first three points of the old and new route are:

OLD ROUTE NEW ROUTE

STR 1A info 1A is a new point
STR 2A info 2A uses data from list point 27
STR 3A info 3A is the same as old STR 1A

To program the changes, access the point data LAT/LONG submenu
(Figure D-7) and select STR 1A at PB #1. Manually enter the data for the
new STR 1A, and then push PB #1 to step to STR 2A. Copy the point data
from list point 27 to STR 2A by inputting list 27 at PB #10 (Figure D-7).
Point data is saved when either a new point is selected or you exit the
submenu. TOT/MEA data is not part of the list point stored information.
Step to STR 3A. Since point data cannot be transferred from one
sequence point to another, the new data for STR 3A must be entered
manually. If you desire to delete a point, display the sequence point at
PB #1. Enter “0” into the scratchpad, then press PB #1 to clear the
sequence point from CC memory. Deleting a target (or steer point) also
deletes the associated offsets (or aim points). You cannot delete base,
mark points or the current aircraft sequence point. If the aircraft is
currently steering to an offset or aim point, you cannot delete the
associated target or steer point. After modifying the route, verify the new
data by stepping through the TSD points or by performing a swing check.

If you want to change a steer point to a target (7A to 7.A) or vice versa,
you can do so on the point data submenus. Simply enter the new syntax
(sequence point and optional letter) through the scratchpad into PB #1.
The aim points/offsets associated with the previous point will be modified
to reflect the syntax of the new point (e.g., target offsets will be changed to
aim points when the target is changed to a steer point and vice versa).

NOTE

The base point cannot be changed, and a designated target cannot be
changed to a steer point (more in future lessons on designations).

AGR-4 D-10


Text from AGR-4_Navigation_page_17.jpeg:
On the point data submenu, (Figure D-7) you can cycle PB #1 through all
sequence points of a particular route (the points cycle in numerical order).
To look at a sequence point of a different route, enter it through the
scratchpad (including the route identifier). Once entered, cycle through
all the sequence points reflecting the new route. To change from base,
mark, 0. or bullseye enter a new point through the scratchpad, including
the route identifier. To review mark points, enter a mark point (M1
through M10) at PB #1, and cycle PB #1 through the 10 mark points (in
numerical order). Review bullseye points in the same manner (B1
through B10).

Figure D - 7.

TOTs can be entered using a missionized DTM or manually on the UFC
point data submenu (or on the UFC data 2 display). There are no TOTs
associated with list points; so, if route points are defined via list points,
TOTs for those points must be manually programmed.

If TOT OFF is displayed at PB #9 (any UFC point data submenu format),
you can enter a TOT through the scratchpad for the associated sequence
point (PB #1). TOTs for other sequence points are not affected. If a TOT
is already displayed (for example TOT 09:00:00), entering a new TOT
changes the PB #9 TOT, but it also changes all other TOTs on that route
by the difference between the old and new TOT. Therefore, to change one
TOT and leave all other TOTs unaffected, use UFC Data 2 rather than a
UFC point data submenu. All TOTs on a particular route can also be

D-11 AGR-4


Text from AGR-4_Navigation_page_18.jpeg:
changed using the Delta TOT capability. The DELTA TOT format is
selected by pressing PB #9 with a blank scratchpad next to any TOT on
the point data submenu. If "TOT OFF" is displayed at PB #9, the DELTA
TOT format is unavailable.

From the Delta TOT format, positive or negative values (shift - on the key
pad) entered through the scratchpad and PB #9 will be added to, or
subtracted from, all sequence point TOTs on the route. Valid Delta TOT
entries are from 1 second to 28 hours, 59 minutes and 59 seconds.
Trailing zeros are assumed (leading zeros are required). For example,
entering “1” to a 10:00:00 TOT would change the TOT to 20:00:00 and add
10 hours to all other TOTs on that route.

USE OF UFC DATA 2

Data 2 is utilized to display information concerning fuel remaining,
ETE/ETA, TOT/TOA and required groundspeed to make a particular TOT.
The above information can be displayed relative to sequence points (steer
points, targets, and base only) as selected by the aircrew.

The information on the first two lines is relative to the line of sight (LOS)
point. The information is valid only if you fly direct to the LOS point
displayed at PB #1. The following applies: (Refer to Figure D-8)

PB #1 - you may enter (through the scratchpad) any steer point
(including base) or target that is stored in the CC, but the SP
identifier number must be equal to or greater than the current
aircraft sequence point. Toggling PB #1 will sequentially step
through subsequent steer points and targets on the displayed route
(A,B,C). If you wish to change the displayed route (A,B,C), simply use
the scratchpad to display any steer point or target on the desired
route. The point at PB #1 does not affect current sequence point
steering (i.e., steering on the TEWS, HUD, ADI, HSI or the points
displayed on the A/A radar, A/G radar, or TSD).

PB #2 shows current aircraft groundspeed (the same as displayed on
UFC Data 1 and on the HUD/ADI if groundspeed is selected from
Data 1 for HUD/ADI display). PB #10 may be cycled to alternately
display fuel remaining or bearing/range information. Both reflect
flying directly to the LOS point at PB #1, and the fuel is computed at
current throttle setting, fuel flow, and current GS (reflected at PB #2).
PB #9 may be cycled to alternately display ETE or ETA to the LOS
point, again based on the current groundspeed at PB #2.

Lines 3 and 4 display information relative to a look ahead point. Display
of the look ahead steer point (including BASE) or target at PB #3 follows
the same logic as display of the LOS point at PB #1 (e.g., scratchpad entry
or toggling). You cannot enter a look ahead point that is earlier on the
route than the LOS point.

Cycling either PB #4, PB #7, or PB #8 alternately displays two sets of
information for the 3 PBs (i.e., if you push any of the three PBs, you
change the information displayed at all three.) The two sets are:

1. PB#4: CG (no number); PB #8: fuel figure in pounds; and
PB #7: TOA.
or

2. PB#4: CG (followed by a number); PB #8 “FUEL REM”; and
PB #7 TOT.

The significance of this information is that if you proceed directly to the
LOS point and then fly the programmed route until reaching the look
ahead point (PB #3) at the command groundspeed (PB #4), you will arrive
at the look ahead point at your preselected TOT (PB #7) with the fuel
displayed at PB #8. All computations (fuels, times, and speeds) are based
on flying the bank angle selected on the TSD.

Text from AGR-4_Navigation_page_20.jpeg:
Do not associate look ahead point fuel remaining (PB #8) or TOA (PB #7)
with command groundspeed. They are applicable only at current
groundspeed (PB #2). Obviously, if your current groundspeed is the same
as command groundspeed then the fuel is applicable to both (and
TOT/TOA will read the same). Remember that look ahead point fuel
remaining assumes that the current fuel flow and ground speed will
remain constant.

If you want to put everything in sync, check the command groundspeed
(PB #4) required to make the TOT (PB #7). Accelerate/ decelerate to make
the current groundspeed (PB #2) match the command groundspeed. Only
then should you check the look ahead fuel figure and TOA. With matched
command and current ground speeds, TOA/TOT (cycle PB #7) are the
same.

An analog command velocity “wiper” is displayed to the left of the HUD
calibrated airspeed window (Figure D-9) (if the gear handle is up, a TOT
has been entered for the current route and the CC clock has been set).
This “wiper” rotates up or down from a horizontal position to indicate the
difference between the current speed and command velocity (CMD VEL)
to meet the next TOT on the current route. The right side of the wiper
points down (slow down) or up (speed up) at a maximum angle of +80° (1°
per knot for a maximum of 80 knots). A horizontal “wiper” indicates the
current speed will achieve the next TOT on the current route.

All aircraft displayed ETEs, ETAs and command speeds are computed
assuming you will turn (using the bank angle selected on the TSD) to
steer directly to the current aircraft steer point/target, and then fly the
route in numerical sequence. Computations are based on turns initiated
over each point (no lead turns). Remember this when flight planning: to
ensure the most accurate aircraft displayed information, always select
coordinates for the exact point at which you plan to begin your turn.

TOTs can be entered on the point data submenu or on Data 2. Entering
(or changing) a TOT on either of these UFC formats also changes that
TOT on the other format. Remember, TOTs changed on UFC Data 2
affect only the TOT assigned to the look ahead point. They do not adjust
other route TOTs like a changed TOT entry does on the UFC point data
submenus.

D-15 AGR-4


Text from AGR-4_Navigation_page_22.jpeg:
CMD speed on the HUD/ADI may be different from the CG displayed on
Data 2 (Figure D-10, right). The HUD/ADI command speed is always to
the next assigned TOT on the current aircraft route. The DATA 2, CMD
GS may be to any point with an assigned TOT, even to a point on a
different route (A,B,C) than the one you are currently flying. Additionally,
the HUD/ADI information is based on flying direct to the current aircraft
sequence point. The UFC Data 2 information is based on flying direct to
the LOS point (which may or may not be the same as the current aircraft
sequence point).

EN ROUTE CUTOFFS, CHANGES

To cut off a portion of the route, decide which point(s) to cut off. Select
Data 2 (Figure D-11) and enter the next desired LOS point at PB #1. For
example, to check fuel, BRG/RNG and timing from near STR 2A direct to
STR 4A (cutting off sequence point 3A), enter STR 4A at PB #1 and TGT
6.A at PB #3. The UFC displays the current GS, ETE or ETA, and either
bearing and range or fuel remaining from your present position, direct to
STR 4A at current GS and fuel flow. Bearing/range or fuel remaining is
cycled by pressing PB #10. ETE/ETA is cycled by pressing PB #9.

With the look ahead point (TGT 6.A) displayed at PB #3, the CMD GS to
achieve the programmed TOT (cutting off sequence point 3A) can be
displayed at PB #4. The TOT/TOA to the look ahead point is displayed at
PB #7, and “FUEL REM” or the estimated fuel remaining is displayed at
PB #8. The fuel figures are based on turning direct to STR 4A, then flying
to the remaining points along the route to the look ahead point, 6.A, at
current groundspeed, fuel flow and TSD-selected bank turns. The LOS
point (at PB #1) and the look ahead point (at PB #3) must be steer, target
or base points. These actions performed on the Data 2 page do not affect
HUD/ADI/HSI/TEWS steering or HUD/ADI command velocity. To steer
direct to STR 4A, enter STR 4A at PB #10 on Menu 1 or Data 1 to display
HUD/ADI/HSI/TEWS steering information and HUD/ADI command
velocity to 4A (assuming a TOT is assigned to 4A, otherwise the command
velocity will be to the next point on the route that has been assigned a
TOT).

Alternate Routes

The CC can store up to 365 points (99 list points, 100 steer points/targets,
100 aim points/offsets, 10 mark points, base, 10 bullseye points, and 45
avoidance points) for en route use and including alternate routes. Routes
with A, B, or C suffixes can be stored during preflight operations,
providing excellent tactical flexibility. For the following example (Figure
D-12), assume a priority target must be struck at a precise TOT,
regardless of weather, threats, or other factors. Preflight planning,
therefore, includes routes A, B, and C with the same TOT and target (8.A,
8.B, and 7.C, respectively). Route A is the primary route; B and C are
alternate routes. The crew ingresses via route A, and passes STR 1A and
STR 2A. At STR 3A, it is apparent the weather ahead is not acceptable.
The crew enters the next feasible alternate route point (STR 5B) into the
LOS point at PB #1 on Data 2. The next route B point with a TOT then
automatically appears at PB #3 (TGT 8.B in this case). The CC computes
LOS range and bearing, ETE, ETA, and fuel remaining from present
position to STR 5B and displays this data at PBs #9 and #10. The CC
displays TOT/TOA, command groundspeed, and fuel remaining at TGT
8.B (via direct to STR 5B). After viewing this data, the crew decides to go
direct to STR 5B, then continue to the TGT on route B. To go direct to
STR 5B, they enter STR 5B at PB #10 on Data 1 or Menu 1 and achieve
STR 5B steering on the HUD/ADI/HSI/TEWS. They will probably want to
select route B on the TSD as well.

Text from AGR-4_Navigation_page_26.jpeg:
Weather and SAMs have forced the aircrew to fly a longer route than
planned. Evasive maneuvers used more fuel than expected. To check fuel
remaining at the base via TGT 7.C, they select TGT 7.C at PB #1 and B
(base) at PB #3 on Data 2 (Figure D-14, left). Flying present position
direct to TGT 7.C then home, they would RTB with 1200 lbs. Note that
their actual fuel remaining should be higher (barring battle damage or
afterburner use) because dropping their ordnance will decrease their drag
index; in addition, they should be able (once in friendly territory) to climb
to a more efficient cruising altitude and perform an en route descent.
After the strike at TGT 7.C, they select B at PB #10 on Data 1 (or Menu 1)
for immediate steering home (Figure D-14, right).

The previous example shows some poor technique in the aircrews’ flight
planning. It is generally advisable to make the IP and target point
numbers match between the A, B and C routes. The C route IP should
have been loaded as 7C and the target as 8.C-this is much easier to
remember, and auto sequencing will function normally from 5C to 7C.
This also helps in the drawing of offset predictions, which may be shared
between 8.A, 8.B and 8.C.

0. Targeting

The zero point (0.) target feature allows the aircrew to visually overfly a
point and get steering and weapons delivery computations to a TGT that
is at a known location relative to the point. The target syntax must be 0.
(no other target numbers are allowed).

Figure D - 15.

Either DIR/RNG or RNG/BRG UFC formats can be used. In preflight
planning, choose a visual point near the target as a backup in case other
delivery options are not viable. For example, using an old airplane at the
10,000 feet marker on the run-in to a range nuclear target (Figure D-15)
as the visual point, the following steps are used to program a 0. target in
the DIR/RNG format (0. data can also be entered in RNG/BRG format,
although this is less accurate than the DIR/RNG format).

e Enter 0. on any point data submenu.

e Press PB #4 to access the DIR/RNG submenu.

e Enter the north directional component (3722 feet) from the old
airplane to the target at PB #2, the west directional component

(9512 feet) at PB #3, and target (repeat, target) altitude (1032 feet)
at PB #7. Remember, the direction is entered in true direction, not

magnetic.

Text from AGR-4_Navigation_page_28.jpeg:
e Ifusing RNG/BRG, you would enter the true bearing from the
visual point to the target (to the nearest degree) and the range (to
the nearest tenth of a mile).

e To designate TGT 0., step to Data 1 or Menu 1 in preparation for
making TGT 0. the current aircraft sequence point (Figure D-16).
Enter 0. in the scratchpad. When you fly precisely over the visual
point (old airplane), press PB #10. This makes TGT 0. the current
target, and steering and weapons delivery computations are to TGT
0.

e After bombing TGT 0. (and in A/G master mode), manually enter
the next sequence point number and route letter (at PB #10) on
Data 1 or Menu 1. This clears the 0. target steering, and resets
NAV steering data to the desired off-target sequence point.

e 0. programming can be checked in the chocks (in A/G master mode).
For example, using RNG/BRG, enter the range and true bearing to
a known point. Then, when 0. is entered as the current aircraft
sequence point on Data/Menu 1, the magnetic bearing and range
can be used to validate the data entry.

INTRODUCTION

This workbook introduces programming and applications of the
navigation system (EGI/INS/MN). It also explains how to use navigation
functions for safe, effective low level navigation. As part of a computer-
based instructional (CBT) lesson, this workbook should be read prior to
taking the CBT instruction.

PROGRAMMING AND CHECKING NAVIGATION DATA

Latitude and longitude data for sequence points (SP) is entered on the
point data LAT/LONG submenu (Figure D-1) as you practiced during the
INS lesson. There are three additional UFC submenus available for
defining sequence points to the CC.

The Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), range and bearing
(RNG/BRG), and directional components and range (DIR/RNG) point data
submenus provide additional flexibility for programming the various
sequence points used in low level/surface attack missions.

Programming Data as UTMs

The UTM is a grid system used to define specific points or areas in a
manner similar to LAT/LONGs. The UTMs consist of a spheroid identifier
that designates a part of the world containing the point. The eight
spheroids are: INTL (International), BESSEL, CLARKE-66, CLARKE-80,
EVEREST, AUST NAT (Australian National), WGS 72 and, WGS 84 (the
aircraft initializes to WGS 84). Within the spheroid are alpha numeric
grid zone identifiers (the southwest corner of a 10,000 meter square block,
e.g., 12 SUL) which provide a specific starting point for the UTM
coordinates. A series of numbers express the point location, in meters,
east and north of the grid zone identifier. UTMs are always read from the
lower left hand corner (southwest corner) of the grid zone to the right
(east) and up (north).

The easiest way to access UTM data is to define the sequence point using
LAT/LONG on the LAT/LONG submenu, then press PB #4, UTM (Figure
D-2) to display the previously entered LAT/LONG data as UTM data on
the UTM submenu. Similarly, if you define sequence points in the UTM
format, the CC performs the conversion and you can display the
information in the LAT/LONG format.

NOTE

The identifier at UFC Point Data Submenu, PB #4, identifies the next
format (LAT/LONG, UTM, RNG/BRG, or DIR/RNG) that will be called

up if the button is pushed. It does NOT identify the currently
displayed format.
