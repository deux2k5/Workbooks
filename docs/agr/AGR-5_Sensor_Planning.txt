Select offsets close enough to course line for a minimum of 0.5° graze
angle. Clutter environments, such as wooded hills, provide unique
problems. A very simple problem commonly overlooked when planning
radar offsets is the presence of 50-foot trees around the desired offset or
aim point. This additional obstacle boosts the altitude required to map
the intended point so an alternate point may be required. The following
diagram demonstrates the linear relationship used to compute the
altitude required for line of sight (LOS) to a point (Figure D-2).

Practical Problem

Several methods are available for determining the proper squint angle
and graze angle. Figure D-3 demonstrates the first technique for aim
point planning.

By marking the left and right 30° and 50° scribes on a plotter (Figure D-3)
and sliding it along your course line (referencing the 90°/270° scribe), you
can determine the point on the course line with acceptable squint angle.
Move the plotter along the course line so the desired offset is positioned
within the marks. Make a mark through the hole in the plotter on the
course line. Measure the distance to the current steer point; this is the
distance from the turn point to start mapping (17.5 nm in Figure D-8).
During tactical maneuvers, you may be right or left of the planned course
or on a slightly different heading. Therefore, plan your offset/aim point
for flexibility.

Text from AGR-5_Sensor_Planning_page_14.jpeg:
To minimize A/G radar time, another option is “Interleaved” PVU (IPVU)
time at PB #16 on the A/G radar. However, the IPVU option has several
disadvantages. It occurs even if MAP FREEZE is selected, and disables
the A/A radar without doing a “sanity” check (it will accept any value).
Also, the IPVU option will not work effectively if velocity errors are
unusually large (over 5 to 6 knots). Also, the aircrew has no way of
checking this information. (IPVU is a MN PVU, but for consistency, we
define PVU as a MN PVU not using the interleaved option.)

Text from AGR-5_Sensor_Planning_page_18.jpeg:
Now that the offset is selected and the mapping point is determined, it is
important to accurately predict how the offset will appear on the display.
Patch maps are generated relative to the line of sight to the point and
presented in the cockpit as if they were straight ahead. Interpreting the
correct aim point is often confusing. Patch map predictions should be
drawn depicting the proper orientation of the scene at the proposed squint
angles. Planning materials need to include a map that depicts forest
shapes and well-defined tree lines. European AFCENT 1:250,000 depict
forestation well, but this is a serious planning limitation in the CONUS
unless imagery is available for mission planning. If using AFMSS
imagery for planning, make sure you apply the right scale. An imagery
print out with .5x scale selected has the same scale as a 1:50,000 map (as
seen in Figure D-8). So you can use the templates described in Figure D-6
for radar footprint predictions. The NAV shops in your squadrons might
also have some overlays that you can use for AFMSS printout predictions.

Another consideration during A/G radar mission planning is selecting the
appropriate size display window. If the mission navigator is updated
regularly and system drift is small, a 1.3 display window may be
acceptable. If the mission navigator has drifted significantly, a 3.3 display
window is probably required. Always work big-to-small to a .67 map for
best designation detail.

The display window template in Figure D-6 is useful for making radar
predictions. The template for the 1:250,000 scale is primarily for area
orientation when selecting aim points. The easiest way to use the display
window template for offset orientation is to place the template on the map
so the line of sight reference on the template runs from the aircraft
position during mapping (on the course line) to the feature being mapped,
as in Figure D-9.

The most useful display window template is 1:50,000 scale. Sufficient
map detail is available to sketch an accurate prediction of desired aim
point with the proper angular relation (Figure D-10). A photocopy with
the display window over the offset, as in Figure D-10, provides accurate
detail; however, a pencil sketch on a lineup card may suffice.

A/G Radar Pacing

In addition to planning when and where to begin A/G radar duties, it is
important to address radar time-sharing. The radar is used primarily in
the A/A mode. If the A/A radar setup is RWSI, 80 mile range, 120°
azimuth scan and six-bar elevation scan, allow 20 to 25 seconds to get
adequate area coverage. At 40 miles the radar will be searching an area
80 miles wide and 16,000 feet high. This time allows two complete frames
and should detect potential threats. In 25 seconds you will travel about

4 miles, so sanitize the area prior to A/G radar operations. Now examine
the time required to complete the update process:

| A Oe 20 sec
2 & patch MAPS... eeeeeeeeeseessssessesstssssssesseteeees 10 sec

Switch actuation ...........cceececeeeeceeecceeccescceeeceueees 03 sec
Total A/G time ..............ccceeeeeeeeeesssesssessesseseeeeeees 43 sec

At 480 knots the aircraft has traveled roughly 6 nm during this period of
updating the MN. If the previous 10 minutes of the low level was
dedicated to A/A search, the odds are the entire tactical situation has not
changed significantly in the last 43 seconds. This is not to say, however,
that an update should be performed on every leg of the low level or that
the WSO should spend 5 minutes watching the RBM display sweep back
and forth. As a minimum, at least one update should be accomplished just
prior to the IP.

However, it is important to keep in mind that a bandit traveling at a
comparable speed could have flown 6 nm for a total of 12 nm closure
during this time. If your last search was on a 40 nm scope, the bandit
could be at 28 miles, perhaps close to fox 1 range (for the bandit) before
you have even resumed your radar search. That is why it is important to
plan mapping opportunities to reduce A/G radar time to a minimum.
Using IPVU also reduces A/G radar time by 10-15 seconds, with very little
reduction in accuracy.

If using EGI as PPKS, subtract 20 seconds or 3 miles from above times
and distances, which enhances your own tactical situation.

STICK MAPS

Now that all mission planning is complete, it is time to gather all the bits
and pieces and get organized. The basic stick map is an ideal method to
organize the information into a useful form. Pilots and WSOs normally
have different areas of interest when constructing stick maps. For
example, pilots are probably more concerned with basic navigation,
turnpoint descriptions, MSAs, ATC requirements, master mode selection
and the attack itself. WSOs normally annotate radar update points, radar
predictions, TGT IR update points and air-to-air search duties, as well as
navigation data and the attack. There is nothing wrong with both crew
members having identical stick maps, but we each have our own
techniques for depicting the desired information. Figure D-12 shows an
example of a stick map. The primary purpose of the stick map is to help
develop a sense of pacing and to remind the crew to perform assigned
tasks during the mission (radar updates, targeting pod updates, air-to-air
search, PACS selection, master mode selection, master arm on, attack
parameters, etc.). These tasks are relatively easy to remember when
flying local sorties on familiar low levels to familiar ranges. However,
confusion increases when flying from an unfamiliar base with peculiar
ATC procedures, marginal weather, darkness, a first-look low level and
tactical targets on an unfamiliar range. Throw in a couple of display
problems and a few marginal systems and the workload increases beyond
belief.

CONCLUSION

Using the techniques mentioned should help organize mission planning
tasks and effectively employ both crew members. There are times when
the situation dictates a deviation from the plan, but the most important
points to remember are that both crew members know the plan and
adhere to it as much as possible. Thorough and accurate mission planning
is the key to effective crew coordination and successful employment of the
F-15E.

TEXT
INTRODUCTION

This lesson is designed to be a practical application of what you learned in
AGR-2 (APG-70 A/G Introduction). It is important to have a thorough
understanding of mission planning considerations to employ the F-15E
sensors properly.

HIGH RESOLUTION MAP (HRM) PLANNING

The synthetic aperture process requires very constrained parameters.
The accuracy of radar maps improves as the angle off the nose (squint
angle) gets larger (to the 60° radar gimbal limit). Maps taken between
30° and 50° provide reasonable accuracy and a gimble margin. The
accuracy and quality of the patch map are also determined by velocity
errors. MN precision velocity updates (PVU) are recommended prior to
patch maps even if an INS PVU was performed.

PVU Planning After TO 1F-15E-737 [Embedded Global Positioning
Inertial Navigation System (EGI)]

Best available velocity is based on the present position keeping source
(PPKS). In EGI PPKS, the best available velocity is the position velocity
consistency (PVC) filter velocity. This velocity is used by the radar for the
construction of high resolution maps. The requirement for a MN PVU
before constructing a patch map is not necessary if using EGI as the
PPKS.

D-1 AGR-5


Text from AGR-5_Sensor_Planning_page_8.jpeg:
The importance of having accurate velocities for HRM mapping is
illustrated in Figure D-1. On a 0.67 nm map made at 10 nm range, 540
kts and 20° squint, a 0.5 ft/sec velocity error results in a 100-foot
positional error. When the velocity error is increased to 1.0 ft/sec, the
positional error increases to 200 feet. You should also note in Figure D-1
that velocity errors are lessened considerably as the squint angles near
the aircraft limit of 60° off the nose. Additionally, you can see why the
aircraft prohibits mapping within 8° of the nose, where even small velocity
errors translate into very large positional errors. Velocity errors of 0.3
knots induce unacceptable position errors and result in display array
shading, which may obscure the desired aim point.

Text from AGR-5_Sensor_Planning_page_9.jpeg:
Map quality is further reduced by low graze angles. At a 500 feet AGL
ingress altitude, the offset/target must be within 2.5 nm, which is actually
too close to map. Experience shows that good quality maps can be made
with graze angles slightly less than 0.5°, which allows mapping out to

10 nm from as low as 500 feet AGL. As the graze angle decreases,
selection of aim points and offsets becomes increasingly important. At
minimum graze angles, it is important to select aim points that are
vertically developed (such as buildings, small peaks, etc.), distinctively
shaped, and preferably associated with radar no-show areas such as
roads, rivers and runways.

These radar constraints dictate a limited window for tactical employment.
The 1:60 rule could prove to be very costly if you fly at 1500 feet AGL,

15 nm from the target area in a “here I am” maneuver after spending the
past 40 minutes at 200 feet trying to remain undetected. As a general
guideline for planning, aim points and offset points should be within

10 nm of course, 30° to 50° off the nose, not obscured by intervening
terrain, and have particular physical characteristics as described earlier.
RBM offset points, such as small peaks, can be on the nose and are
relatively accurate.
