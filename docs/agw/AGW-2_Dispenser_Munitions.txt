SUU-64/B / SUU-65/B / SUU-66/B Dispensers

The SUU-64/B, SUU-65/B, and SUU-66/B tactical munitions dispensers
(TMD) (Figure D-3) are three-piece clamshell cluster munitions
dispensers. They are normally used with the FZU-39/B proximity sensor
fuze that offers cockpit selectable function modes. The aircrew has the
option of changing from integral fuze function [TIME] which is nose
arming only, to FZU-39 proximity function [HEIGHT] which arms both
the nose and tail solenoids.

NOTE: On preflight, make sure the fuze arming lanyard is routed
correctly. The nose arming solenoid must also be energized when
selecting the FZU-39 since the integral timer fuze is the source of
electrical power for the FZU-39 proximity sensor. Energizing only the
tail arming solenoid will result in the dispenser impacting the
ground intact since the FZU-39 will otherwise receive no
electrical power to operate.

Text from AGW-2_Dispenser_Munitions_page_11.jpeg:
The SUU-65/B is a SUU-64/B with a modified tail section that imparts
spin to the dispenser to enhance submunitions dispersion. When the
dispenser reaches the preset function altitude, the fuze activates the fin
cant, causing the dispenser to spin. Upon reaching the proper spin rate,
the SUU-65/B opens. The SUU-66/B is a SUU-64/B with the Gator mine
electronics package removed, and the airbag system installed to eject the
submunitions.

SPECIFIC MUNITIONS
The CBUs discussed use the SUU-64/B, SUU-65/B, or SUU-66/B. The

combination of a particular dispenser with a particular submunition
results in a particular CBU designation.

CBU-87 Combined Effects Munitions (CEM)

CBU-87 CEM is a SUU-65/B dispenser loaded with 202 BLU-97/B
bomblets (Figure D-4). The bomblet case is made of scored steel designed
to break into preformed fragments for defeating light armor and
personnel. It also contains a forward-firing, shaped charge liner for
defeating armor, plus a zirconium ring for incendiary capability. This is a
multiuse weapon.

WARNING

CBU-87/B and S/B have experienced
numerous submunition airbursts
immediately following submunition
arming. These airbursts affect safe
separation from submunition shaped
charges during level deliveries when
releasing multiple weapons in the timer
mode. Refer to Section VI of TO 1-1M-34
for delivery restrictions.

CBU-89 Gator

CBU-89 consists of a SUU-64/B dispenser containing 72 BLU-91/B
(Figure D-5) and 22 BLU-92/B submunitions. The BLU-91/B antitank
mine is a magnetic target-sensing submunition. Detonation occurs when
the magnetic sensor detects a target, when the mine is disturbed, at the
expiration of the self-destruct time, or when the battery voltage drops
below a specified level. The BLU-92/B antipersonnel mine has a
fragmenting case warhead triggered by one of eight 40 foot trip wires.
Detonation occurs when a target activates the trip wire, when the mine is
disturbed, at the expiration of the self-destruct time, or when the battery
voltage drops to a specified level. The Gator is an excellent area denial
weapon for both armor and personnel.

CBU-97/B SENSOR FUZED WEAPON

The CBU-97 sensor fuzed weapon (SFW) consists of a SUU-66/B TMD, an
airbag dispensing system, 10 BLU-108/B submunitions packaged in two
bays of five, an integral timer fuze, and the FZU-39/B proximity sensor.
SFW is designed to provide multiple kill per pass capability against tanks,
armored vehicles, artillery, APCs, and support vehicles.

The BLU-108/B submunition consists of a nose electronics section,
warhead launcher assembly, rocket motor, and orientation/stabilization
device (OSD). The nose electronics section contains the power supply,
safe-arm device, sequencer, and radar altimeter. The launcher assembly
holds four skeet warheads (four skeet for each BLU-108/B or a total of 40
skeet per SFW munition). The OSD consists of externally mounted fins, a
drogue parachute, and a main parachute.

SFW is delivered as an unguided, gravity drop, direct attack or limited
standoff munition. After release, the SUU-66/B TMD falls and opens as
discussed earlier. When the TMD skin is released, two gas generators fire
inside the TMD inflating forward and aft bay airbags. As gas pressure
fills inside the airbags they expand, overcoming the release locks on the
restraining bands, ejecting first the five submunitions in the forward bay,
followed by the five submunitions in the aft bay.

AGW-2 D-8


Text from AGW-2_Dispenser_Munitions_page_15.jpeg:
The skeets are antiarmor warhead projectiles and function as the kill
mechanism of the SFW. Each contains a thermal battery, a passive
two-color IR sensor, processing electronics, a safe-arm device, and an
explosively formed projectile warhead (Figure D-6).

Text from AGW-2_Dispenser_Munitions_page_16.jpeg:
The skeets are canted slightly during articulation so that upon release
from the spinning submunition, their flight path will contain a slight
wobble (Figure D-7). This is referred to as coning. As the skeets fly away
from the submunition they are spinning and coning. The spinning arms
the skeet via rotation of the safe-arm device while the coning action
causes an IR seeker boresighted to the spin axis of the skeet to describe a
scan pattern across the ground. A single skeet will cover a search area
approximately 100 feet wide and over 300 feet long. The scan patterns of
all forty skeet from a single CBU-97 canister will describe a search
pattern 1200 feet long and 700 feet wide. Skeet operation is depicted in
Figure D-8.

Figure D - 8. Skeet Operation.

The individual warheads seek targets based on predetermined two-color
IR signatures. When a target is detected, a processor in the skeet issues a
fire pulse to the detonator within 60 ms (+10 ms). The explosive output of
the detonator initiates the precision initiation coupler. This initiates the
high explosive which in turn produces a high velocity, aeroballistically
stable charge, called an explosively forged penetrator. This explosively
formed projectile hits and penetrates the engine area from the top of the
target inflicting a mobility kill. If the skeet does not detect a target
during the fly-out period, a self-destruct feature detonates the warhead
8.0 seconds after release.

FUZES

FZU-39/B Proximity Sensor

This proximity sensor (Figure D-9) is used with the SUU-64/B, SUU-65/B,
and SUU-66/B dispensers. It has selectable arming time and height of
function settings. It transmits a signal which it uses to determine vertical
height. When a SUU-64/B or SUU-66/B reaches the preset height, the
sensor sends a fire pulse to the integral fuze, opening the canister. On the
SUU-65/B, at preset height, the sensor sends a signal for fin cant causing
the dispenser to spin. Then when reaching the preset spin rate, the
canister opens. There is also a selectable ECM feature. The FZU-39
options are shown on Figure D-10. The PACS program should mirror the
correct fuze settings. Time or height of function is cockpit selectable.

If the FZU-39/B fuze was not available, the dispensers have an integral
timer fuze. However, expect that the FZU-39/B fuze will be available and
tasked to be used in the height of function mode. The radar proximity
fuze provides more consistent minefield dimensions or frag patterns and
more liberal release parameters than the integral timer fuze.

FZU-39/B ECM Mode

The FZU-39 ECM mode is selected by an on/off switch on the side of the
fuze. When the ECM switch is positioned to the ON position and the fuze
is unable to determine height above ground due to the presence of
jamming, the ECM mode is activated. If the ECM mode is able to defeat
the jamming, the fuze will function normally. If the ECM mode fails to
counter the jamming, the fuze will open the dispenser after a two-second
delay. This normally results in the fuze functioning to open the dispenser
at other than the desired height above ground. However, this ECM
feature at least provides for dispenser opening even when radar range is
denied.

If the ECM mode is selected and no ECM is experienced, the fuze will
function normally. Not selecting the ECM mode in a jamming
environment may result in the dispenser impacting the ground intact.
Further detail of how the ECM mode functions is not necessary for the
level of knowledge required to plan for and employ Gator mines and CEM
munitions. The important point is that the ECM mode should always be

selected.

WEAPON/FUZE COMBINATIONS

The many different munitions the F-15E can carry accommodate a variety
of fuzes that can have numerous settings. Each combination of weapon,
fuze, and setting will produce a predictable effect on a given target. An
example can be shown with the CBU-87. Delivery is most flexible with
the FZU-39 with HEIGHT function selected by the crew. If TIME is
selected, delivery parameters become increasingly important, since fuze
function is controlled only by the integral timer as opposed to the
proximity fuze. With TIME selected the dispenser will fall for the preset
number of seconds and then open regardless of altitude. If you are too
high you do not get the desired submunition density. If you are too low
the dispenser may hit the ground before opening.

Targeting

Targeting, for the purpose of this discussion, is the matching of munitions
with the desired effect on a target. Targeting is normally accomplished at
higher headquarters by the people who have “the big picture.” They use
the Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEM) as their “Bible” for
weapon selection. The JMEMs are the authoritative source of information
needed to select weapons and estimate the force requirements to achieve
the desired results.

Munitions Selection

The following are examples of munitions matched to targets to maximize
target destruction.

CBU with Instantaneous Fuze

Since CBU munitions are quite small and depend on small high speed
fragments to be lethal, the target must be unprotected (even trees can
diminish the killing power). CBUs are good against:

° personnel

¢ light trucks

¢ unprotected fuel/ammunition
° radar vans/antennas/SAMs

° aircraft on the ground

AGW-2 D-18


Text from AGW-2_Dispenser_Munitions_page_25.jpeg:
CBU with Delayed Fuze

These munitions are excellent for area denial. The Gator mines are
especially good for denying armor or personnel movement through an
area.

CBU-87 or Skeet

The shaped charges are specifically designed for use against armor.
CBU-87 is also outstanding against personnel, light vehicles, lightly
protected fuel, ammunition, radar vans, antennas, SAMS, and aircraft in
the open.

WEAPON CHARACTERISTICS

The dispenser munition is one of several types of ordnance carried by the
F-15E. The dispenser munition consists of a larger case, called the
dispenser, which contains smaller submunitions. This lesson covers the
various types of dispensers and submunitions, and how they function.

Cluster Bomb Units (CBUs)

CBUs are dispensers loaded with various submunitions. Each CBU has a
designated design purpose. Also, the numbering of the various CBUs can
be confusing. CBU designation is derived from a combination of a
dispenser type and different submunitions.

D-1 AGW-2


Text from AGW-2_Dispenser_Munitions_page_8.jpeg:
Dispensers

During employment, a dispenser may remain attached to the aircraft (as
the submunitions are released) or be released as a free-fall unit. This
discussion is limited to the free-fall type, as that is the most common.
Free-fall dispensers are carried and released much like general purpose
bombs. They are designed as clamshells with three longitudinal sections
(Figure D-1). The clamshells blow apart at a predetermined time after
release or at a preset altitude. At this time, the submunitions are
released into the airstream. The altitude above the ground at which the
fuze functions (and separates the clamshells) is known as the height of
function (HOF). The HOF, dive angle, and airspeed determine the size of
the pattern of the bomblets on the ground. A larger pattern decreases the
density of the bomblets. Refer to the Dash 34 to determine the delivery
parameters and fuze settings for the desired area coverage.

Submunitions

There are various submunitions or bomblets (Figure D-2) that can be used
in the dispensers. The F-15E only carries and delivers CBU-87, CBU-89,
and CBU-97. Most of the submunitions are designed for light material
and personnel in the open. Others with a shaped charge are good against
armor. The primary kill mechanism for CBU munitions is fragmentation,
but other important elements are armor penetration and incendiary
effects.
