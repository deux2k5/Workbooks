Offset Pop-Up

The most common type of pop-up delivery is the offset pop, also known as
an indirect pop. This type of pop-up delivery is defined by an angle off
(AO) ranging from 15° to 90°. Remember, the difference between your
approach heading and your attack heading constitutes the angle off
(Figure D-2).

Initial Point
There are two ways to get from the IP to the PUP in an offset pop. One
choice is to fly from the IP directly to the PUP, as shown in Figure D-3.

This approach course steering initially points you to the side of the target.

The other choice is to depart the IP and fly directly at the target. Then, at
a given range from the target, execute a check turn left or right for offset
(the point where the turn is started is the action point), delay as required
and then pop-up (Figure D-4).

Figure D - 4. IP Direct to Target.

Although it looks more complicated, this choice is often quicker to plan
and is the more common choice among aircrews. It is sometimes referred
to as a “whip pop.” It also can be flown from any attack direction, without
the need to overfly the IP, simply by putting the target on the nose and
actioning at the planned range. This option can be useful for reattacks,
especially after threat reactions.

Advantages

The offset pop-up has several advantages. First, target acquisition is
simplified because during the climb to pull-down altitude the target is not
hidden under the nose of the aircraft, and you have time to look for the
target. Second, as you acquire the target in the climb, you are able to see
any corrections needed to achieve the correct parameters. Third, it
enables you to maneuver the aircraft three dimensionally, making it
difficult for target area threats to track you.

AGW-4 D-6


Text from AGW-4_Pop-Up_Attacks_page_13.jpeg:
Disadvantages

Reliance on a faulty INS or timing errors could place you in unacceptable
parameters, i.e., inside the MAP when rolling out to begin tracking. Make
every attempt to use easily identifiable visual references for the IP, action
point and PUP. Second, the maneuver may expose you to the heart of the
enemy defenses. Hence, you do not want to increase your tracking time
beyond the minimum needed to accurately get weapons on target and
thereby increase your exposure to the enemy.

Direct Pop-Up

The second type of pop-up delivery is called the direct pop-up because the
final approach course to the pull-up-point (PUP) is within 0-15° of the
planned attack axis, which gives you a 0-15° angle off (Figure D-5). Even

though a direct pop may be up to 15° angle off, they are normally flown at
zero degrees angle-off (target on the nose).

Text from AGW-4_Pop-Up_Attacks_page_14.jpeg:
The direct pop-up is an instrument maneuver; no attempt is made to
visually acquire the target until rolled out on final. Direct pops can be
accomplished in AUTO or CDIP. In practice, you will usually see this type
of delivery called a LAT (low-altitude toss), which is a modified direct pop-
up performed in AUTO where you pickle and start a pull prior to bomb
release. A typical direct pop-up pattern is depicted in Figure D-6.

PULL-UP

4.5NM _ TGT

AGW-04-06

Figure D - 6. Direct Pop-Up Profile.

You must approach the pull-up point with a good designation (RDR or
TGT IR). The AUTO designation and ASL will help with the rollout and
target acquisition. At the computed pull-up point begin a wings level 4 Gs
in 2 second climb to the planned climb angle. Relax the climb G
approximately 2-3° prior to reaching the desired climb angle to avoid
overshooting. (The WSO may be able to acquire the target during the
climb and redesignate with the TGT POD). At the computed roll-in
altitude, unload and roll to wings level inverted. Then, smoothly pull 4 Gs
in 2 seconds. In the roll and pull over the top, you may have displaced the
ASL a few degrees opposite your roll direction. Ensure your pull is
parallel to the ASL, not toward it. Approximately 5° prior to reaching the
desired dive angle unload the aircraft, roll into the ASL, steady out on
your dive angle and then look to acquire the target. During the roll to
upright you will lose 3-5°, thus putting you at the desired dive angle. If
you rolled out with the same G as you rolled in (1 G being desired), and in
the same direction, the ASL should be centered. If it is not, turn toward
the ASL as you attempt to acquire the target. As an alternative, a 0.5 G
bunt may be used to transition from the climb to the dive but this must be
well planned, since it will affect the pull-up range and the bunt altitude.

AGW-4 D-8


Text from AGW-4_Pop-Up_Attacks_page_15.jpeg:
If you are using an AUTO delivery you can either bomb the designated
target (pickle and pull up the ASL) or, if the designation is off,
undesignate and redesignate the target visually. If the target is acquired
with the AUTO reticle short of the target, undesignate, track the pipper to
the target and redesignate. Then follow the ASL pulling 2-4 G’s. Bomb
release will occur while you are in the pull.

If the reticle is long of the target at acquisition and the designation is
inaccurate, you have two options. The first option is to select CDIP via
HOTAS and visually designate the target with the CDIP pipper, if you are
still above pickle altitude. If the CDIP pipper is already past the target or
you are below release altitude, then go through dry. On the next pass
increase the pull-up range.

Advantages / Disadvantages

Essentially, a direct pop is the only way you can visually identify a target

(through the NAV FLIR) at night (low level ingress) when you do not have
a TGT IR pod. It also has an advantage when compared to an indirect pop
in having the least exposure time. However, it has several disadvantages.

First, it requires precise instrument flying and an accurate designation.
Errors in either of the above could lead to the target not being in the FLIR
FOV upon rollout. This may force an abort since the extent of your errors
cannot be determined until after the rollout.

Second, the target cannot be seen visually during the climb. Time is
critical to attempt to identify the target and correct any designation errors
once rolled out.

Common Errors

e Pulling up or down with less than the computed G putting you inside
the MAP

e Attempting to acquire the target while inverted/during rollout

e Not using unloaded rolls resulting in large azimuth deviations (target
no longer in HUD field of view)

e Attempting to center the ASL during inverted pull-down

Pop-to-Level

A third type of pop-up delivery is the pop-to-level (Figure D-7). It is used
when a very low altitude approach is desired to minimize threat exposure.
The crew climbs close to the target to achieve fuze arming, safe escape,
safe separation, weapon effects or visual acquisition in a level release
profile. The climb is a 5 Gin 2 second pull to a climb angle equal to the
number of feet to climb divided by 100 (i.e., 2000 ft to climb - use 20°).

The pushover should begin at 40 ft per degree of climb angle below the
bombing altitude (i.e., 400 ft prior for a 10° climb, 800 ft prior for a 20°
climb). This delivery is often planned as a weather backup (ceiling too low
for planned delivery but high enough to allow frag clearance).

Advantages

This maneuver enables the crew to drop a low drag bomb using a level
delivery under low ceilings. Second, it allows you to clear the
fragmentation, achieve the desired fuze arming times and achieve the
desired impact angle. Third, popping-to-level aids in target acquisition by
letting you get higher, particularly if the target has little or no vertical
development.

AGW-4 D-10


Text from AGW-4_Pop-Up_Attacks_page_17.jpeg:
Disadvantages

The first disadvantage of the pop-to-level maneuver is that climbing out of
the low level environment exposes you to the enemy defenses, and if a
straight ahead egress is executed, overflight of the target and defenses
adds to the exposure. Second, the length of time maintaining straight and
level at release altitude gives the enemy gunners a fairly predictable
target. Therefore, the amount of time at release altitude should be kept to
a minimum, similar to the angular deliveries (5 seconds is ideal). Also,
frag may cause problems for you or for a wingman in trail, forcing him to a
higher altitude or more time between aircraft to ensure frag deconfliction
(covered in detail in TAC-2).

Aborts

Any pop-up maneuver should be aborted if any of the following conditions
occur:

Actual pull-up point inside planned pull-up point (for FTU/MQT
students)

Roll-in pointed at wrong target (no changing targets after roll-in to
final) (for FTU/MQT students)

Roll-in requires more than 90° or less than 15° of turn, except for
direct pop-up (for FTU/MQT students)

Airspeed below 350 KIAS (300 KIAS above 10,000 ft AGL)

Actual dive angle exceeds planned dive angle by more than 5° (10° if
recovery altitude is above 10,000 AGL)

Target is not positively identified
Satisfactory entry/release conditions are not achieved
Discernible horizon reference is lost

Aircraft passes below the minimum release altitude

POP-UP PLANNING

There is a positive correlation between the quality of your planning and
the quality of execution. The more effort spent in mission planning, the
easier in-flight execution becomes.

Planning With Auto Systems

The F-15E, with its computed modes (AUTO/CDIP), is capable of dropping
accurate bombs at practically any combination of altitude, dive angle and
airspeed. However, if actual release parameters differ from planned
conditions, fuze arming times, weapons effects, dive recovery and/or safe
escape criteria may not be met.

Adhere to planned release parameters in order to
e ensure safe separation.

e ensure fuze arming.

e achieve desired weapons effect.

e provide frag clearance.

@ provide ground clearance.

Steps in Planning an Attack

There are several steps involved when planning a pop-up attack. The first
and most important step is to calculate a minimum release altitude
(MRA). This is to keep you from killing yourself during the delivery! The
MRA is based on the highest of safe escape, safe separation, vertical drop
required for fuze arm, altitude lost during dive recovery and an altitude
that gives the desired weapons effect. The second step is to plan the
actual pop-up maneuver and planned release altitude (above the MRA)
based on computed release conditions. These computations are made
using the Combat Weapons Delivery Software (CWDS). The final step is
to take the planned attack, and put it onto paper so that it can be used in
the cockpit. The following sample problem illustrates this flow.

Enter the coordinates and elevations for the Target and IP. Ensure the
TDA is correct. Three TDA modes are available (““Elev/Temp,” “Density
Alt” or “Press Alt/Temp”). “Elev/Temp” is usually the easiest method and
when they are entered, CWDS will automatically calculate the TDA which
is used by the computer to determine safe escape data and weapons
ballistics.

Wind Model Data

Wind model data can be entered (from the initial input page) by selecting
“Options” and “Wind Model....” You may now select one of three options
(“None,” “Ballistic” or “F-15E”). An important planning note is that Safe
Escape will not be computed in your attack calculation if you select any
wind model option other than “None.”

Ballistics Tables /Safe Escape Tables

Before calculating the actual minimum release altitude for your delivery,
you should look at the ballistics tables for the ordnance, delivery and safe
escape maneuver combination you plan on employing. These ballistics
tables are produced using the CWDS program. (The flying squadrons may
still have copies of the outdated ballistics manuals, but remember that the
CWDS program is the only currently authorized version for weapons
ballistics.)

information, the CWDS program will produce tables which can be
previewed on screen or printed (see Table D-1) to compare with the results
obtained when CWDS calculates an MRA for your planned delivery
profile. This will provide a safety check to ensure the delivery will work
as planned and not result in either a “dud” weapon or “fragging” yourself.
Care must be taken to ensure the correct ordnance and delivery profiles
are used.

many dive angle and airspeed combinations for both single and multiple
releases of the selected weapon. Tables are produced for both 0’ and 5000’
TDA. Again, use these tables as a “sanity check” for your planned
delivery to ensure it can be accomplished safely.

This is where the remainder of the inputs are entered including: the type
of “Entry” (None, Pop-Up, Fly-up, Bunt Pop, Direct Pop), “Wing Pos/Dist”
from lead (None, Left, Right), dive angle, airspeeds, tracking time, G and
onset rates for the maneuver, and “Attack Options” (Distance/Heading,
Distance/Angle, Angle/Heading). Distance/Angle is a common one to use
when you wish to select an action range based on a specific distance from
a target to the action point (INS ground range makes this easily readable
in the HUD) and a desired angle off (as in this example). A good rule of
thumb for angle off is somewhere between 2 X climb angle (minimum
angle off) and 80° to allow room for any repositioning maneuvers. Most
sets of plotters used to draw pop-up attacks include templates for 45° (for
10° deliveries) and 60° (for 20° deliveries) of angle off. “Action Distance”
and “Angle-Off” can be directly entered on this page. Also on this page is
a list of possible options for the desired safe escape maneuver. A final
input (and the one that causes the most confusion) is the desired “Release
Alt Mode,” which determines how CWDS calculates the minimum release
altitude (MRA) you will use for the attack.

Calculating the Minimum Release Altitude (MRA)

As mentioned earlier, the minimum release altitude is the highest of safe
escape altitude, safe separation altitude, altitude required for fuze
arming, altitude required for dive recovery or altitude required for
weapons effect.

Safe Escape Warning

When using CWDS to plan weapon deliveries at minimum release
conditions, deviations from planned delivery/recovery conditions may
result in a significant increase in the risk of self-fragmentation.

Therefore, the aircrew must observe the appropriate delivery parameters,
minimum release altitudes and recovery maneuvers required for safe
escape/separation. Additionally, the CWDS program computes safe escape
data based on self-fragmentation. For leader/other aircraft frag
deconfliction, minimum recovery altitudes from the Maximum
Bomb/Rocket Fragment Travel Chart (TO 1-1M-34) must be used or
additional deconfliction is required.

Release Altitude Computation

When planning a minimum release altitude, always plan for the worst
case. The following technique will ensure you will be able to deliver your
weapons safely. Since an attack can be continued up to 5° steep, a good
technique is to plan for a delivery that is 5° steeper than you actually
desire. In this example, we are planning a 20° delivery, so we will
compute the MRA using 25°.

CWDS provides three altitude options: “Specific Alt,” “Min Rec Alt,” or a
“Planned Rel Altitude.” For initial computation of MRA, use "Planned
Rel Altitude " and a low “Min Recovery/Release” altitude (1000A for
example) to ensure the program forces a calculated MRA that is above
your input. A “Variable Parameter” window now appears, allowing you to
select “Airspeed,” “Dive Angle,” or “Press Time” as a variable to
compensate for errors in arriving at the release point. Select “Dive Angle”
and enter 0° in the deviation field, as you have already allowed for a 5°
steep delivery.

NOTE

CWDS will also compute the same MRA if you enter your planned dive
angle (20 in the example) and 5° as the deviation. However, this
method only shows data for the entered dive angle, not for the 5° steep

pass. Although the MRA provided by CWDS is still correct, you will not
be able to determine upon what constraint (such as fuze arming, safe
escape, etc.) the MRA is based.

When all data is entered, you may preview or print the resulting data by
selecting “Preview Output” or “Print Output” at the bottom of the page. It
is strongly advised that you check the output on the screen (before you try
to print the final results) to ensure it passes the “common sense test.” The
output will appear like Table D-2 with the MRA information (altitude and
driving factor) near the end.

Notice the computer is even “smart enough” to change some of your inputs
automatically (in this example, Fuze Arm Time) to meet all criteria (safe
escape, safe separation, etc.). Ensure these changes are made known to
the rest of the flight and maintenance if any weapons settings are
affected! The information in Table D-2 was computed using the “Planned
Rel” option with 5° steep as an input.

Delivery Altitude “Pad”

Up to this point, calculations have only been made for release at the MRA.
It is very important to note the MRA numbers given in the MRA section of
the CWDS printout are for an unpadded release. Since any problems
(target acquisition, lining up on the target, etc.) can cause a delay in
dropping the weapons, it would be easy to go below the MRA if trying to
pickle right at the minimum altitude. For this reason, you need to “pad”
your release altitude (i.e. you should plan to release at a specific altitude
high enough to allow you some sort of “pad” or press factor).

One of the simplest techniques available to compute a “pad,” and a good
rule of thumb for “press” is to add an altitude equal to your planned dive
angle X 30 (600 feet for a 20° diving delivery). Another common technique
is to add an altitude equal to the amount lost in two seconds of track time.
This is calculated by the formula of 2 seconds X true airspeed X 1.69 X
sine of the dive angle (2 X 500 X 1.69 X 0.3420 = 578 feet for this
example). The sine of the dive angle is obtained from Table D-3. Notice
the results are similar.

Text from AGW-4_Pop-Up_Attacks_page_34.jpeg:
You will want to obtain a final CWDS printout for the planned delivery
with your desired “press” factor added in to use in putting your attack on
paper (map or attack card). This can be done by going back to the Dive
Delivery page, inputting the planned dive angle (20° in this example), and
changing the “Release Alt Mode” to “Specific Alt.” Enter an altitude that
is higher than the previously calculated minimum release altitude by your
“press” factor. Using the rule of thumb in the last paragraph, 4000A
would work well for this example (3393A computed unpadded release
altitude from CWDS output plus 600’).

It is important to note for this example that you must go back to the
initial input page and increase the fuze arm time to 6 seconds to meet the
safe separation required for the radar fuze. (This is changed
automatically when using the “Planned Rel” mode, but not when using the
“Specific Alt” mode.) The final attack you have planned is now shown in
Table D-4.

Ripple Release

If a ripple release is desired, number of weapons to drop, type of drop
(string for ripple single or multiple for ripple multiple) and impact spacing
need to be entered on the Dive Delivery page. These factors should be
input at the beginning of the planning process (calculating the MRA) to
ensure the planned release altitude is based on the ripple release. The
output is essentially the same through release and weapon conditions,
where the first, last, and center bomb ranges, altitudes and times of flight
will be listed. The center of stick ranges are used for calculating the MAP
(Table D-5).

Plotting the Attack

Drawing the Attack on Charts

Once release conditions have been calculated and are known, start
plotting out the pop-up attack on a map. Accuracy is critical during the
planning and plotting and the more accurately planned, the better the
results during the execution will tend to be.

First, find the bomb range under Weapon Conditions. The MAP, aim off
distance and the Track/Map Altitude are found in Tracking Information.
The release altitude is found in Release Conditions. With these values, we
can plot the bombing triangle (Figure D-12).

Text from AGW-4_Pop-Up_Attacks_page_46.jpeg:
From the bomb triangle, we shift to a “God’s Eye” view and begin plotting
the attack on a chart. Normally, a 1:50,000 or a 1:24,000 chart is used for
attack planning (if available). With the God’s eye view, start at the target
and work out. Begin by drawing a circle around the target at the MAP

distance and a line out from the target to the MAP on the desired attack
axis as shown in Figure D-13.

Figure D - 13.

Next, from the ROLL-IN/PULL-DOWN DATA section, find the ROLL-
IN/PULL-DOWN TURN RADIUS. This is normally between 4000' and

5000' depending on how aggressive the maneuver over the top is (4.5 or
3.5 Gs).

Finally, when planning and plotting an IP direct to target/action point
offset pop-up attack, the CWDS program may not compute the proper turn
radius at the action point. This may result in a tight pop-up attack and
the perception of popping late. To help alleviate this problem, work from
the target, to the MAP, to the ROLL-IN, to the PULL-UP point and then

back to the action point. Also, remember the more precisely planned and
plotted, the better the results will be.

Templates

Pop-up planning templates are available in many squadrons and often
pilots or WSOs have their own pop-up templates. Exercise caution when
using these templates because you are trusting someone else’s work and
all the assumptions they made when building the template. Be especially
careful, that it is the same scale as the map that you are using! You must
still calculate the numbers (using CWDS) for your weapon types, delivery
and conditions to ensure the attack can be flown as plotted. Plan a good
attack and fly the attack as it is planned!

Attack Card Preparation

Once the attack has been planned and plotted, it must be put into a usable
format for the cockpit. First, draw the attack on the map and convert the
AGL numbers to MSL numbers (Figure D-17). One way to get a cockpit
usable format is just to reduce the map the attack is drawn on. This can
be done on a copy machine. This is the quickest and simplest method of
making an attack planning card. However, due to coordinate grids,
contour lines, target depictions, etc., it could become cluttered and hard to
read once shrunk down.

An alternate to this method is a “Thumbnail Sketch” attack card. This
attack card reduces the map into a hand drawing depicting the essential
geographical features (Figure D-18). This takes longer, but is more
readable in the cockpit. Other attack cards may be more or less elaborate
depending on the target area and visual references available.

POP-UP POSITIONING ERRORS

The most common error that necessitates a repositioning maneuver is a
missed PUP caused by inadequate mission planning, navigation errors,
unfamiliar terrain, weather and/or defensive reactions due to threats. If
the PUP is missed, three things must happen. First, recognize that you
are not on planned parameters. Second, assess whether you have
sufficient turning room to complete the attack. Third, assess whether a
repositioning maneuver is required.

Five broad categories of errors exist that require repositioning. They are
outside PUP, outside planned run-in, inside PUP, inside planned run-in,
and inside PUP and run-in.

Outside PUP

If you initiate the pop too soon, as seen in Figure D-19, the options are:

LEGEND

——— PLANNED

AGW-04-19

Figure D - 19. Outside PUP.

e Reduce G and climb angle, pull-down at a slightly higher than planned
altitude and intercept the planned dive angle and attack axis (best
solution due to flying to the preplanned parameters).

D - 47 AGW-4


Text from AGW-4_Pop-Up_Attacks_page_54.jpeg:
e Pull-down at the planned altitude and accept a longer track time,
lower dive angle and new attack axis.

e Check away from the target, pull-down at a higher altitude, and
intercept the planned dive angle at a lower airspeed and further from

the target thereby increasing tracking time.

e Reduce angle-off by turning toward the target (use care not to have
less than 15° AO).

e All are acceptable; however, they all increase exposure time.
Outside Planned Run-In

If you are outside the planned run-in line when you pop, you can (see
Figure D-20):

AGW-4 D - 48


Text from AGW-4_Pop-Up_Attacks_page_55.jpeg:
Pull-down at a higher altitude and intercept the planned dive angle at
a lower airspeed and further from the target. This increases tracking
time.

Pull-down at the planned altitude and accept a shallower dive angle
with more tracking time and on a different attack axis.

Inside PUP

If you are past the planned PUP (Figure D-21), you only have a few
choices:

Pull to a higher climb angle, pull-down slightly early and intercept the
planned attack (this takes aircraft back to preplanned parameters).

Check away to use lateral turning room, pull down slightly late and
accept the increased track time.

Pull-down early and accept a shallow dive angle, more tracking time
and a different attack heading.

Abort the attack (here at F-15E FTU, this is the correct choice).

Text from AGW-4_Pop-Up_Attacks_page_56.jpeg:
Inside Planned Run-In

A pop initiated inside the planned run-in line (Figure D-22) may be
correctable if the problem is not severe and recognized early.

e Immediately turn back toward the planned track and intercept it prior
to pull-down (best solution due to flying to the same roll-in point and
preplanned parameters). Attack axis is farther around the MAP; abort
if angle off exceeds 90°.

e Ifyou are well inside the run-in line or you recognize it late, reposition
outside the planned run-in line because of the additional turning room
required to bring the nose back to the correct aim off distance at the
track point.

e Abort the attack if satisfactory entry/release parameters are not
achieved.

Text from AGW-4_Pop-Up_Attacks_page_57.jpeg:
Inside PUP and Run-In
The worst situation is to be inside the planned run-in line and

pull-up-point (Figure D-23).
The best option is to stay low, egress the area, and then reattack, hit

e
an alternate target, or return to base.
If you are forced to attack, a 180° reversal may be required (not an

e
option at F-15E FTU).

CREW COORDINATION
Individual Duties

As in other mission phases, crew coordination duties during low level,
weapons delivery, etc. should be addressed during the crew briefing.
However, these delineations must be flexible enough for adjustments
when required by the situation and/or individual preference.

Pilot Duties

During pop-up attacks, it is the pilot’s primary duty to fly the planned
attack and deliver ordnance on the target. To do this, the pilot must
achieve the correct release parameters for the maneuver being flown so as
to achieve the desired weapons effects and to avoid fragging himself or his
wingman. The pilot must also evaluate the designation and redesignate if
required. They will also set the FCP switches in accordance with the
appropriate checklist. As always, not hitting the ground is of primary
importance. If threats become a factor, the pilot will maneuver the
aircraft as necessary.

WSO Duties

In general, the WSO will perform all functions and duties that are not
performed by the pilot. These include initial designations, switch changes,
PACS functions, UFC inputs, A/A and A/G radar operations, TFR changes,
and other duties required to strike the target that can be performed in the
RCP. The WSO has primary responsibility for threat lookout and
countermeasures employment. The WSO must also maintain mutual
support with other flight members during the attack. The WSO should
also assist the pilot in target acquisition and maneuver accomplishment, if
possible. This possibly includes “talking the pilot’s eyes onto the target,”
calling altitudes/ airspeeds/dive angle, and monitoring safe escape. This
should not interfere with the WSOs lookout responsibilities. As always,
not hitting the ground is of primary importance.

AGW-4 D - 52


Text from AGW-4_Pop-Up_Attacks_page_59.jpeg:
Mission Element Duties

Prior to the IP

The WSO keeps the navigation platform updated in both position and
velocity so a NAV designation will be as accurate as possible. The WSO or
the pilot clears the target area with the A/A radar and prepares for the
final designation, if required. The pilot flies the aircraft and ensures
ground clearance.

The pilot normally stays in the NAV master mode, although this is not
absolutely required, until just prior to the IP in order to work timing and
get steering to the IP in case the WSO designates early. Strive to be at
the IP on time so you can concentrate on flying the planned attack and not
worry about making timing corrections IP to target. At or just prior to the
IP, the pilot should select A/G master mode and turn the master arm on if
it is not already armed. The WSO checks the PACS for proper
programming and a RDY indication. The WSO should also confirm the
VTRS is recording and the TEWS is set. Both the pilot and WSO should
review the planned attack and be mentally prepared to fly it.

IP to Target

IP to target, the pilot’s main job is to fly the attack. The pilot must
maneuver the aircraft, as required, to put bombs on the target which
means flying the planned attack as closely as possible. The pilot should
use both the aircraft systems and visual/timing reference points to find
the pull-up point and the target. If a final designation is required, the
WSO should get it as soon as possible and give the radar/command of the
HUD to the pilot. The WSOs primary responsibility now becomes
defensive. This includes visual lookout, maintaining mutual support as
much as possible, TEWS employment and terrain clearance. The WSO
gives the pilot any assistance deemed necessary to properly execute the
attack (or that was briefed during crew coordination) such as an “UP” call
at the pull-up point, a “pull-down” call at pull-down altitude, etc. The
WSO should be especially cognizant of minimum release altitudes for safe
escape. The pilot should keep the current designation until the target is
sighted and the aircraft is in position to deliver ordnance. The pilot may
then undesignate and/or thumb aft to CDIP, as required.

AGW-4 C-2


Text from AGW-4_Pop-Up_Attacks_page_60.jpeg:
Egress

After weapons release, the pilot must complete the planned safe escape
maneuver. The pilot may select auto guns to enhance radar look-out and
prepare for a possible air-to-air engagement. The pilot also needs to be
careful about buddy locks, which may set off the wingman’s RWR. As
always, the pilot’s main job is terrain avoidance. After completion of the
safe escape maneuver, the pilot flies the planned egress routing and
regains mutual support. Once clear of the target area and mutual support
has been regained, the pilot should return control of the radar to the
WSO. During the safe escape maneuver, the WSO should continue visual
look-out and maintain mutual support. The WSO may need to talk the
pilot’s eyes onto other formation members or direct maneuvers to regain
mutual support, and take command of the radar. The WSO should
initially clear the egress routing in SRM and then MRM. The WSO
should also check the PACS and confirm any remaining/hung ordnance.

TEXT
POP-UP ATTACKS
Introduction

The objective of tactical fighter operations in air interdiction missions is to
delay, neutralize or destroy the military potential of the enemy before it
can be effectively brought to bear against friendly forces. Deception and
surprise are two invaluable ingredients in achieving success in any attack.
They both can be achieved to some degree when a pop-up delivery is used
in conjunction with a low level approach.

A pop-up attack allows an aircraft to ingress low altitude, then reposition
to a visual high or low drag weapon release profile and get back into the
low altitude environment with minimal exposure. This attack profile
enhances visual acquisition of the target and helps in satisfying weapons
effects, dive recovery, safe separation and safe escape requirements.
While in the pop-up profile, the aircraft is maneuvering in three
dimensions, making enemy tracking difficult; but pop-up attacks require
precise planning and execution to ensure target destruction and
survivability of your own aircraft.

Terms
The following terms are illustrated in Figure D-1.

Initial Point (IP)

The point along the low level route where the air-to-ground target attack
commences. Preferably, the IP should be a visually significant point.

Approach Heading

The heading from the initial point (IP)/action point to the pull-up point
(PUP).

Angle Off (AQ)

The angle between the extension of the approach heading and the attack
heading.

Text from AGW-4_Pop-Up_Attacks_page_8.jpeg:
Pull-Up Point (PUP)

A position at which the climb is initiated. Also called the pop-up point.
Climb Angle

The angle of climb that is to be achieved during the pull-up.
Pull-Down

A maneuver to transition from the climbing to the diving portion of a
pop-up delivery.

Pull-Down Point

The geographical point in space where the pilot rolls the aircraft to
initiate the pull-down maneuver.

Pull-Down Altitude

The altitude at which the pilot rolls the aircraft to initiate the pull-down
maneuver.

Pull-Up to Pull-Down Distance

Distance covered along the ground during the climb between the pull-up
and the point where the pull-down is initiated.

Apex

The highest altitude attained in the pop-up delivery.
Track Point

A point in space where target tracking is initiated.

Tracking Time

The amount of time with wings level on final between track point and
pickle.

Attack Heading

The planned heading to be flown on final, from the track point to the
release point.

Text from AGW-4_Pop-Up_Attacks_page_9.jpeg:
Minimum Attack Perimeter (MAP)

An imaginary circle centered on the target with a radius equal to the
distance from the target at which tracking begins. The radius of the circle
varies with delivery parameters, track time and type of munition.

MAP Distance

Distance from the MAP to the target (MAP distance = bomb range +
ground distance covered while tracking).

Aim-Off Distance (AOD)

The distance from the target to a point on the ground beyond the target
that is the projected flight path of an aircraft in a dive delivery. This is
the same point where the velocity vector is placed to achieve given
parameters in a diving delivery.

Release Altitude

Planned altitude where weapons will be released from the aircraft (equal
to minimum release altitude (MRA) + press factor, discussed later in
workbook).
