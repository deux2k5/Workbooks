AIR COMBAT COMMAND


Text from AVI-12_Degraded_Avionics_Operations_page_10.jpeg:
ADI May be displayed on any MPD/MPCD but is the only
display available on the front cockpit MPCD.

TSD Not available in the front cockpit. May be displayed
on either rear cockpit MPCD.

A/A Radar,

A/G Radar,

TEWS, and

TF Can be displayed on any MPD but not on MPCDs.

The radar initially defaults to the A/A format; however, the A/G format
can be selected from the radar display. Except for the FCP MPCD, which
provides only a “hardwired” ADI, the remaining displays may be scrolled
through, as desired, to obtain the formats available on each display. The
available (scrollable) formats are listed in Figure D-2. Note that the TSD
format is not available in the FCP and no HUD repeater is available in
the rear cockpit.

The HSI is not an available display format in either cockpit. The compass
rose, TCN/NAV data blocks, and TCN/NAV bearing pointers are still
available on the TEWS display (Figure D-3) and some of the HSI functions
are transferred to the ADI format (Figure D-4). Some information (e.g.,
function of bank steering bar, display of pitch steering bar, ILS
localizer/glide slope raw data) is dependent upon what steer mode is
selected. These multimode/steer mode dependent display features are
addressed in the following section as they apply to the HUD, but
remember, such information is generally applicable to the ADI as well.
Section I of the Dash 1 contains illustrations of the ADI with the different
steer modes selected (ADI—backup mode).

Another very noticeable indication of CC failure is the MPDP (as bus
controller/integrator) defaulting the HUD to a degraded format.

Figure D - 5. HUD Format with CC Failure (NAV Steer Mode).

The MPDP defaults the HUD to the same degraded format regardless of
the master mode selected. In fact, master mode selection is inoperative.
However, changing steer modes does affect the HUD presentation (see the
asterisked items in Figure D-5). This information is generally depicted
just as it would be on a normal HUD with the NAV or INST master mode
selected. Remember that the HUD repeater is not available in the RCP
when the CC fails. HUD programming and symbols reject functions are
not available.

Upfront Control (UFC)

When CC failure occurs, any UFC displayed information which requires
CC computation/support (that is not assumed by the MPDP) is blanked on
the UFC. The MPDP initially defaults the UFC to Menu 1 (Figure D-6).
Note that the current steer point (PB #10) initially defaults to STR 0
indicating that no steer point is available for navigation. Remember, the
routes were stored in CC nonvolatile memory.

Figure D - 6. UFC Menu Options (CC Failure).

D-7 AVI-12


Text from AVI-12_Degraded_Avionics_Operations_page_14.jpeg:
The MPDP supports selection and display of the following UFC formats
(Figure D-6).

@ Menu 1 and 2
@ Point data lat/long submenu (from Menu 1, PB #10)
@ PP keeping source submenu (from Menu 2, PB #4)

e INS is the only PP source available for navigation. If MN
or EGI was selected prior to CC failure, the PP source
defaults to INS automatically at CC failure.

Additionally, with CC failure the MPDP/AIUs continue to support and
allow display of the following UFC formats/information.

@ UHF 1 and 2 (row 5 & 6) including UHF 1 and 2 submenus
(including the KY-58 submenu)

@ TACAN including TACAN submenu but excluding TACAN
program submenu

@ = IFF/AAT including submenus but excluding the IFF phasing
submenu and the EID submenu

Data 1 and 2 formats are not available. If an unavailable UFC format is
requested, the UFC display will not change.

The MPDP supports the capability for only two steer points. The HUD,
ADI, and TEWS NAV data blocks initialize as NAV INV (HUD) or STR
NONE (ADI/TEWS) while the UFC (Menu 1) initializes to STR 0. To
enter data for the two steer points, call up the UFC point data submenu
and enter (STR) 1 and/or (STR) 2 and their respective lat/long coordinates.
No syntax other than 1 or 2 will be accepted. These points can be
successively changed as the aircraft progresses along a flight route
(leapfrog). Only manual sequencing is available. Current NAV steering
(NAV data blocks on the HUD/ADI/TEWS, the bank steering bars in the
HUD/ADI and the bearing pointer on the TEWS) reflect the current steer
point showing at Menu 1, PB #10 (again either STR 1 or STR 2).
Command (CMD) heading is not available on the HUD or ADI.

TSD/RMR

With CC failure the TSD format loses cursor related functions because
TGT IR and radar patch maps are not functional capabilities with CC
failure. Therefore, the sensors cannot be cued from the TSD.
Additionally, the look ahead function is inoperative and most of the
pushbutton options normally available are unavailable with CC failure
(Figure D-7).

Figure D - 7. TSD CC Failure Format.

The TSD continues to provide all primary status cues; i.e., “MAP NOT
AVAILABLE,” “SCALE NOT AVAILABLE,” “RMR NOT READY,” etc. It
provides selectable parameters for MAP scale; i.e., TSD range. Note in
Figure D-6 (Menu 2) that the UFC UPDT MENU format (OVERFLY,
HUD, ALTITUDE, TACAN) is not one of the available UFC formats.
However, with CC failure, the INS can be updated by defining the point
on the UFC point data submenu, selecting the point as the current steer
point (Menu 1, PB #10), then overflying the point and pressing PB #16
(O/F UPDT) on the TSD display to accomplish the update (Figure D-7).
This procedure updates the INS directly (no Kalman filtering); so
obviously, this capability must be used very judiciously. Again, the TSD is
available only in the rear cockpit with CC failure.

Text from AVI-12_Degraded_Avionics_Operations_page_16.jpeg:
PACS

CC failure results in the loss of the ARMT display format and many PACS
capabilities, including all AIM-120 functions.

Remaining operable PACS functions/capabilities include:

AVI-12

Master arm (including RCP advisory light and the HUD gun
cross)

Weapons release (pickle) buttons

Manual free fall or retard (FF/RET) air-to-ground weapons
delivery (as selected with the FCP selective jettison knob)

AIM-7 (single target track [STT] or FLOOD)

AIM-9 boresight or uncaged shots (no seeker reference circles or
radar slaving available)

AIM-120 inhibited
The gun fires normally, but you cannot select firing rate or
set/monitor rounds count. The gun cross or manual sight

provide the only aiming references.

Air-to-air and air-to-ground selective jettison (no combat jettison
[CBT JETT])

Emergency jettison (“panic button”)


Text from AVI-12_Degraded_Avionics_Operations_page_17.jpeg:
The following is a short synopsis of available combat capability.

A/G Radar Real beam map (RBM) only, no high
resolution map (HRM). No RCP control
of radar.

A/G Weapons Delivery Visual, noncomputed deliveries only.

Sight depression angle can be entered
on UFC Menu 2. (RET 0 replaces
GCWS and 0-250 mils are selectable
through a UFC scratchpad entry).

A/A Radar Range-while-search (RWS), single
target track (STT), and track while scan
(TWS). No RCP control of radar.

A/A Weapons Delivery Employment of AIM-7s/AIM-9s. No
AIM-120 capability (AIM-120 launch

initiate is inhibited).

Caution Functional Capability

With CC failure, the MPDP continues to support all systems that have a
display caution capability. The warning, caution, and advisory lights also
work normally for the available systems. The main difference is visual,
with the cautions displayed on the radar format only (Figure D-8). The
displayed cautions do not blank out any background display
(nonoccluded). Selecting the radar format for display provides any display
cautions, even if the radar is off or inoperative. Obviously, with the
illumination of the master caution and/or other caution lights, you would
call up a radar display and check the display cautions. The built-in test
(BIT) system is a CC function, so with CC failure, there is no BIT display
available, and the BIT system is inoperative.

CC Failure Corrective Action

The principal corrective action available to the aircrew whenever CC
failure occurs or is suspected, is to press the CC reset button located on
the FCP sensor panel (Figure D-9). Another possible means of resetting
the CC is to cycle the CC switch on the ground power panel to OFF and
back to AUTO if CC reset did not work.

Text from AVI-12_Degraded_Avionics_Operations_page_23.jpeg:
DOUBLE GENERATOR FAILURE

The aircraft electrical system provides full capability to the normal
avionics systems as long as at least one main generator is on-line.
However, if neither main generator is on-line (i.e., double generator
failure), avionics systems are affected as follows.

Failure Indications

Failure of both main generators results in the immediate blanking of the
HUD and all MPDs/MPCDs, except the FCP MPCD, which defaults to the
ADI format (Figure D-10). No other display format is available. Double
generator failure includes failure of the central computer, so all the
failures induced by a CC failure are also induced by double generator
failure. However, many of the backup capabilities available with a CC
failure are unavailable with a double generator failure. A CC failure
backup, for example, provides four steer mode selections on the ADI. With
double generator failure, only the NAV steer mode is available, because
the TACAN and ILS systems, themselves, are inoperative.

D-17 AVI-12


Text from AVI-12_Degraded_Avionics_Operations_page_24.jpeg:
As shown in Figure D-10, display cautions are displayed at the bottom of
the ADI. These cautions can be removed or recalled by moving the pilot’s
castle switch in any direction. The warning, caution, and advisory lights
are fully supported (assuming the emergency generator is operating in
AUTO/MAN). Display blanking and illumination of numerous caution
lights (about 7, including L GEN/R GEN) is the big clue to double
generator failure, along with landing gear unsafe indications (horn/light in
gear handle), because the ADC is not powered.

Functional Capability

TO 1F-15E-1 and TO 1F-15E-1CL-1, Emergency Power Distribution,
provide a complete list of operative/inoperative systems with double
generator failure. The following is a partial list of lost avionics
capabilities.

CC ILS AIU 2 AHRS (prior to GPS)
ADC/ADP PACS HUD OWS

MPDs AAI KY-58 AOA GAUGE

RCP MPCDs UHF 2 TEWS VVI gauge

TACAN RALT ADF

With double generator failure the following avionics components remain
operative (assuming the emergency generator is operating in AUTO or
MAN modes).

MPDP (supports FCP MPCD with ADI only)

UFC (degraded since the CC has failed with double generator failure)

FCP MPCD (ADI only)

INS and EGI (after GPS installation - backup attitude/heading only)

IFF (EMER only)

UHF 1 (UHF 2 is inoperative)

Intercom

AIU 1

Standby ADI, altimeter, airspeed indicators (AOA and VVI are
unpowered)

AVI-12 D-18


Text from AVI-12_Degraded_Avionics_Operations_page_25.jpeg:
NOTE

The emergency generator switch may require cycling to the ISOLATE
position and back to the AUTO position to obtain the ADI on the front
cockpit MPCD. On aircraft before 89-0497, if a double generator

failure occurs, the front cockpit MPCD may not receive enough power
to operate and consequently the ADI display will be lost. If this occurs,
use the standby flight instruments, which will still be operational
(except AOA and VVI).

Corrective Action

Accomplish the double generator failure procedure. If one main generator
can be brought back on-line, all the avionics equipment will again be
operative. If this is not possible, use the operating avionics (listed in

TO 1F-15E-1CL-1) to return to base. Double generator failure is obviously
an emergency procedure and depending upon conditions (night, bad
weather, etc.), can be a very serious situation. The only available cockpit
lighting is the storm flood lights and the utility lights.

Text from AVI-12_Degraded_Avionics_Operations_page_26.jpeg:
MPDP FAILURE

The MPDP is powered as long as the MPDP/AIU 1 switch on the ground
power panel is in AUTO and aircraft power is available; i.e., at least one
main generator operating or the emergency generator operating in the
AUTO or MAN mode (not in ISOLATE). Internally (within the black box)
the MPDP is configured with four separate power supplies. As shown in
Figure D-11, display processing channels are powered to preclude loss of
the entire MPDP capability should a single power supply (P/S) failure
occur within the unit.

Failure Indications
Partial Failure

Partial failure usually results from a MPDP internal power supply
malfunction and causes the loss of the displays and display formats as
shown in Figure D-11. At least one display should be available in each
cockpit. Available displays can be time-shared with available display
formats as mission requirements dictate.

AVI-12 D - 20


Text from AVI-12_Degraded_Avionics_Operations_page_27.jpeg:
Complete Failure

Complete failure of the MPDP usually results from a total failure of the
processor itself, or loss of power to the MPDP. The HUD and all the
MPDs/MPCDs go blank (or display STANDBY). If the CC is operating,
the UFC continues to function normally; however, if the CC and the
MPDPFP are both failed, the UFC is blank. The UHF radios continue to
operate but channel frequency changes are not possible (blank UFC).

Corrective Action

Corrective actions for failure of the MPDP consist of actions to restore
electrical power.

@ Ensure that at least one main generator is operating, or the
emergency generator is operating in other than the ISOLATE
mode (AUTO or MAN).

@ Ensure that the MPDP/AIU 1 switch on the ground power panel
is in the AUTO position (cycle as appropriate).

@ Ensure that an ECS overheat condition has not caused an
automatic avionics shutdown (ground operations, single engine).

@ On the ground, with a partial failure, perform (if available) a
DSPL (MPDP) BIT.

@ There are three MPDP circuit breakers on the No. 2 circuit
breaker panel (left side, rear cockpit).

@ The most effective action is to reset the MPDP by cycling the
MPDP/AIU 1 switch on the ground power panel to OFF and
back to AUTO.

Obviously, with no displays available, your capabilities are seriously
degraded. All standby instruments are operational (assuming generator
power). Additionally, the UFC Data 1 display provides altitude, speed,
and bearing/range to NAV points. However, with no displays available,
there is no means to get TACAN or ILS steering.

Text from AVI-12_Degraded_Avionics_Operations_page_28.jpeg:
AIU FAILURES

The AlUs (AIU 1 and AIU 2) provide the interface between the aircrew
and aircraft systems; e.g., turn on, turn off, select modes, change
channels, etc. AIU failures manifest in the loss of continuity between a
switch/button and the avionics equipment itself. If the failure is an
internal processor failure, the equipment remains in its last operating
state (OFF/ON, mode selected/deselected). If the failure is an internal
power supply failure, then the equipment is, in effect, turned off. The
equipment is still operable, but is isolated from the avionics system.

Three possible AIU malfunction conditions may exist:
@ Partial failure of either or both AIUs.
@ Total failure of either AIU.
@ Total failure of both AIUs.

Failure Indications

Partial AIU Failure

Initial notifications of partial (or total) failure of either AIU may be
indicated by:

AIU 1 CAUTION displayed on the MPD/MPCD
(Figure D-12). Cautions (lights and display cautions)
are unreliable and are not displayed.

AIU 1 or 2 Illumination of the AV BIT caution to alert the aircrew
to check the BIT status. If AIU 1 has failed a BIT, the
legend “AIU 1” appears in the BIT failure window. If
AIU 2 has failed a BIT, the legend “AIU 2” appears in
the BIT failure window.

Figure D - 12. AIU 1 Failure Caution.

Total Failure of Either AIU

Total failure of AIU 1, ATU 2, or both AIUs results in the inability of the
aircrew to interface with, or complete loss of, the equipment as depicted in
Figure D-13.

Equipment with a redundant backup capability (Figure D-13, center
column) continues to function normally with complete failure of either
AIU. All components without redundant capability are affected when
their associated AIU fails (Figure D-13).

Total Failure of Both AIUs

Remember, if failure results from internal processor failure(s), the
components remain in the last position and are usable (for example, the
affected UHF would operate, but frequency change would not be possible).
A malfunction which causes an internal AIU power failure causes the
components to be unusable (AIUs are used to turn on equipment). Loss of
both AIUs blanks rows 1 through 6 on both cockpit UFCs and all control
stick avionics switch functions (HOTAS) are lost, except for weapons
release (pickle) buttons and the FCP trigger. Throttle switch functions
are also lost, except the speed brake switch.

Corrective Action

With partial AIU 1 failure and/or partial or total AIU 2 failure, a possible
corrective action is to run an AIU BIT.

Corrective action for AIU 1 failure is to cycle the MPDP/AIU 1 switch on
the ground power panel. You should use this action judiciously, since
cycling the MPDP blanks all the displays momentarily or perhaps longer
if the MPDP does not reinitialize. Try the AIU BIT before cycling the
MPDP/AIU 1 switch.

On the MPDs/MPCDs there are no mechanical OFF flags to warn of
degraded/failed components. Numerous “graphics” means are used to
provide failure notifications. Generally, if information is invalid, its
normal location on the HUD/ADI/HSI is replaced with “OFF” (colored red

If the TACAN is failed, not powered, or the selected TACAN station is off
the air/out of range (and TACAN is the selected steer mode), the CDI,
course arrow, and bank steering bar are removed from the HUD. The
TACAN data block displays “OFF.” On the ADI, the bank steering bar is
removed. Normal and TACAN failed HUDs are shown in Figure D-16.

ILS Failure

The cues for ILS not powered/data invalid generally follow the same
pattern as those for TACAN data invalid. On the HUD the glide slope
deviation scale/caret, the CDI and course arrow, and pitch/bank steering
bars are removed. The ILSN/ILST data block remains valid as long as
NAV/TCN range information is valid (depending on whether ILSN or
ILST is selected).

ADC/ADP Failure

The primary indications of ADC/ADP failure are OFF displayed for
vertical velocity, calibrated airspeed, and barometric altitude, and loss of
AOA on the HUD/ADI. There is a warning light (unsafe gear indication)
in the landing gear handle and a PITCH RATIO display caution. The
standby VVI and AOA gauges display OFF flags. If airborne, the landing
gear warning tone activates and can be silenced by the landing gear
warning tone silence button adjacent to the landing gear handle. Due to
the various system interfaces, information normally provided by the
ADC/ADP (to the CC for instance) is lost and may cause navigation/attack
steering to become unreliable. The ADC/ADP requires at least one main
generator for power. There is an ADC/ADP circuit breaker in the rear
cockpit. Other than that, the aircrew has no control over the ADC/ADP.

D-31 AVI-12


Text from AVI-12_Degraded_Avionics_Operations_page_38.jpeg:
Standby Instruments

VVI (both cockpits) - Displays an OFF flag if electrical power is lost or
information is not valid (ADC/ADP failure).

Standby ADI (both cockpits) - Displays an OFF flag if power is lost or the
gyro is caged.

AOA indicator (front cockpit only) - Displays an OFF flag if electrical
power is lost, information is not valid (ADC/ADP failure), or if an internal
failure occurs.

HUD

If you experience difficulties with the HUD, ensure it is turned on and
that brightness/contrast controls are properly set. From a BIT display
format, selecting MAINT, then DSPL allows the aircrew to perform a
HUD BIT or select the backup (secondary) HUD graphics processor at
PB #12 (Figure D-21). The P or S at PB #12 indicates which processor
(primary or secondary) is selected. There are three HUD circuit breakers
on CB panel No. 2 (left side, rear cockpit).

INTRODUCTION

The F-15E aircraft avionics system is designed to operate as an integrated
unit with the CC as the system controller. The MPDP and AIUs provide
an interface between the CC and the system display and control functions,
respectively (Figure D-1).

Figure D - 1. Components.

When the CC fails, the MPDP becomes the system controller and provides
degraded operation of selected system components and displays to provide
a self-defense and return to base capability.

This lesson covers how failures affect those systems whose degrades/
failures have not been previously presented. Since normal operation for
these systems has been covered, we will discuss only the avionics system
malfunction indications, modified capability, and corrective actions.

A chart showing system/component status relative to various avionics
failures is found in Table D-1. You may find it helpful to refer to it as you
read the text in order to understand the “big picture” for each avionics
failure.

Text from AVI-12_Degraded_Avionics_Operations_page_9.jpeg:
CC FAILURE

Total CC failure is usually obvious; however, some malfunctions and
partial failures may be insidious. Since most system data is used for more
than one function, other systems and equipment should be checked
anytime a CC malfunction is suspected. Only total CC failure is
addressed in this workbook.

Failure Indications

MPDs/MPCDs

The most obvious indicator of total CC failure is presented on the
MPDs/MPCDs. When total CC failure occurs, the MPDP becomes the
avionics system controller and defaults the MPDs/MPCDs to a set display
format. You may find it helpful to think of this as a “CC failure master
mode.” These initial displays are the underlined formats in Figure D-2.
Following the initial default, the displays can be scrolled through the
other available display formats.
