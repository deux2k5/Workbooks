DISPLAYS, CONTROLS, AND INDICATORS
Power Switch

This rocker switch is used to turn the MPD/MPCD on or off (Figure D-4).
This switch rests in the center-off position. On power up, the MPD/MPCD
comes up at 50% default brightness level and is fully active. The
day/night switch on the interior lights control panel controls the default
brightness level. The displays initialize to the format/selections which
were last selected prior to shutdown. Momentary power interruptions do
not require cycling the switch.

Brightness and Contrast Switches

These two rocker switches are used to adjust the brightness and contrast
of stroke and/or raster video for display (Figure D-4). They do not affect
the sensor gain sent from the MPDP. The switches rest in the center-off
position. Backlighted arrows on the switches indicate where to push for
an increase or decrease in intensity.

BIT Indicator

The BIT indicator or ball (Figure D-4) is magnetically controlled and rolls
over from black to white when the MPD/MPCD has failed. It will
automatically reset when the malfunction is corrected or after a display
power on/off cycle, and will hold the last indication when power is
removed. It may also be cleared by running a “Display,” “AUTO,” or
“MPDP” built-in test. An individual display BIT may be accomplished for
a specific display by selecting “MAINT,” “DISPLAY,” “THIS DISPLAY” on
the BIT 1 page, which will covered in a later lesson.

Push Buttons

The 20 push buttons mentioned earlier provide control of display
functions. By pressing them you can change display formats, select
display options, control subfunctions, etc. They are usually referred to by
the legend adjacent to them in a particular format; however, they can be
referenced by position number (Figure D-4). Notice that the push button
directly below the BIT ball is #1 and the sequence is counterclockwise
around the MPD/MPCD.

HOTAS Controls

The switches and buttons located on the FCP stick, the FCP throttles, and
RCP hand controllers are known as HOTAS (Hands On Throttles And
Stick) controls. Two of these switches, which control certain functions of

the MPD/MPCDs, are discussed here.

FCP Castle Switch

The front cockpit display control switch, called the castle switch because of
its shape, is a five-position, momentary contact toggle switch, located on
the stick (Figure D-5). It can be moved left, right, forward, aft, and
depressed. If a set of displays has been programmed on an MPD/MPCD,
toggling the switch toward the MPD/MPCD scrolls the display. Toggling
the switch toward the HUD alternately selects air-to-air or air-to-ground
master modes. Depressing, releasing, and toggling the switch toward a
MPD/MPCD or the HUD initiates the take command function. Display
scrolling, master modes, and the take command function are explained
later in this lesson.

RCP Coolie Switches

The RCP display select/command switches, called coolie switches because
they are shaped like coolie hats, are located on the left and right hand
controllers (Figure D-6). The left and right hand controllers allow control
and operation of the left and right set of MPD/MPCDs, respectively. The
coolie switch is a four-position, momentary toggle type that can be moved
forward/aft and left/right. If a set of displays has been programmed on
the MPDs/MPCDs, forward and aft movement of the coolie switch scrolls
displays. Left and right movement initiates the take command function.

Display Formats

So far you have just seen blank MPD/MPCD screens; however, this occurs
only if power is off or if a failure exists. Normally, there is something
displayed. Once you turn a unit on, it initializes to the format displayed
at shutdown. In all cases (except an armament display below the top
level), an “M” or “M2” is in the lower right corner at PB #11 (Figure D-7).
Pushing the button next to it always returns the display to one of the two
menus.

PROGRAMMING AND SCROLLING

Each MPD/MPCD can be programmed by the aircrew to sequentially
display up to three different formats. This allows the aircrew to
“optimize” the cockpit displays for specific missions or functions and
rapidly switch to other displays. The displays are scrolled by using the
castle switch in the front cockpit or the coolie switches in the rear cockpit
(HOTAS, remember?). FCP and RCP programming and scrolling
operations are completely independent of each other.

Programming

MPD/MPCD display sequence can be programmed through the MC/DTM
or in the aircraft. In the aircraft you can program all, some, or none of the
MPDs/MPCDs, as desired. Programming the displays is an easy
procedure as described below.

To program an MPD/MPCD, a menu must be displayed. Push the PROG
button; this initiates the programming mode and places a box around
PROG (Figure D-9).

Text from AVI-2_MPD-MPCD_page_18.jpeg:
Select the display formats in the order you want for scrolling by pushing
the appropriate buttons in order. A boxed number 1, 2, or 3, and its
display format name appear in the center of the menu (Figure D-9). The
boxed sequence number also appears adjacent to the selected format.
These are program sequence numbers and they are assigned in the order
the buttons are pushed. You exit the programming mode by one of two
ways: (1) push the PROG button, which unboxes PROG, or (2) scroll off
the menu via HOTAS. For reference, the selected display formats and
their assigned program sequence numbers remain on the menus.

To replace one programmed format with another, select the programming
mode. Push the button of the programmed format you wish to delete; the
format name and boxed number disappears from the center of the menu
display. Then push the button of the format you wish to program; it
replaces the deleted display in the scrolling sequence. To reorder the
formats in the program, first delete all programmed formats. Next, select
the new formats in the desired scrolling sequence. Last, deselect “PROG”
or scroll to exit the program mode.

Front Cockpit

By moving the appropriate switch you can scroll through the display
formats you have selected on each MPD or MPCD. In the front cockpit,
toggling the castle switch left scrolls the left MPD presentation in the
programmed sequence (Figure D-10).

Text from AVI-2_MPD-MPCD_page_20.jpeg:
Similarly, toggling the switch to the right scrolls the right MPD. Toggling
aft does the same thing for the MPCD with one important variation. The
first aft movement of the castle switch brings up the ADI display on the
MPCD and starts a five second timing cycle. Further aft movement
within five seconds sequences the MPCD as programmed. Once the time
has elapsed, the next aft movement reinitiates this “ADI cycle.”

Rear Cockpit

The coolie switches on the left and right hand controllers perform the
display scrolling for their respective set of MPDs/MPCDs (Figure D-11).
In the figure below, the right hand control is used to scroll the right MPD
and MPCD. Toggling forward scrolls the MPD while aft scrolls the
MPCD. The left hand controller coolie switch scrolls the left displays
(forward for the left MPD, aft for the MPCD).

Master Modes

There is another way to change some or all of the programmed
MPD/MPCD display formats by pushing just one button. It allows rapid
transition between a set of systems and displays needed to conduct a
specific operation. This also simplifies operation and reduces crew
workload. This method uses the master mode buttons on the HUD control
panel (Figure D-12).

Figure D - 12. Master Mode Button Location.

Here is an example of how you might use master modes to change display
formats. On low level ingress you want specific display formats, like A/G
radar, TEWS, TGT IR, etc., arranged a certain way. These could be
programmed to the NAV Master Mode. However, if you are intercepted by
an enemy fighter, you need air-to-air systems and displays up
immediately! Punching the A/A Master Mode button could do just that in
a matter of seconds.

D-15 AVI-2


Text from AVI-2_MPD-MPCD_page_22.jpeg:
Programming

Three of the master modes, air-to-air (A/A), air-to-ground (A/G), and
navigation (NAV), are programmable; the fourth, instrument (INST), is
“canned” or preprogrammed. The procedure for programming is as follows

(Figure D-138).

Figure D - 13.

AVI-2

First, select Menu 1 or Menu 2 on the
MPD/MPCD. Then select program (PROG) on
the menu displayed at PB #6. This initiates the
program mode and boxes PROG. Remember,
before a display format can be assigned to a
master mode, it must have a display sequence
number assigned to it.

Next, push PB #7 (M/M button) until the desired
master mode (A/G, A/A, NAV) appears. In this
case NAV is selected.

Push the button adjacent to the system display
format to be associated with that master mode.
The master mode legend will appear next to the
selected display format. This procedure is
accomplished for each master mode program
desired. Exit the programming mode by one of
the ways explained previously under
“Programming.”

Program all, some, or none of the MPDs/MPCDs,
as desired, for 1, 2, or 3 of the programmable
master modes.


Text from AVI-2_MPD-MPCD_page_23.jpeg:
Limitations

There are a few other things to remember about master mode
programming. One is that, if an MPD/MPCD is not programmed to a
given master mode, it does not change when that master mode is selected.
Second, you are always in a master mode; when power is applied to the
aircraft, it initializes to the master mode the aircraft was in at engine
shutdown, unless the weapons select switch isin GUNS. The aircraft
initializes to the A/A Master Mode in that case. Finally, remember that
the push of each master mode button changes MPD/MPCD displays to
whatever has been “tied” to master mode programming, which may be an
inconvenience to the other crew member - so crew coordinate on this
action. Finally, when in the A/G, NAV, or INST Master Mode, moving the
FCP castle switch forward (without depressing it first) selects the A/A
Master Mode. If in A/A Master Mode, pressing the castle switch forward
selects A/G Master Mode.

D-17 AVI-2


Text from AVI-2_MPD-MPCD_page_24.jpeg:
Instrument Master Mode

The “canned” program for the Instrument Master Mode allows the crew to
quickly transition to a set of basic instrument displays consisting of the
air-to-air radar display on the left MPD, the ADI on the MPCD, and the
HSI on the right MPD in the FCP (Figure D-14). In the RCP the HSI and
ADI automatically come up on the left and right MPCDs, respectively.
The rear cockpit center two displays (left MPD, right MPD) do not change
with selection of the Instrument Master Modes.

GUNS

One other switch that brings up a master mode is the weapons/mode
switch on the right forward throttle (Figure D-15). By moving it aft to the
GUNS position, air-to-air radar is automatically displayed on the left front
MPD, and A/A Master Mode is selected. The left front MPD cannot be
programmed or scrolled with the switch in GUNS. The menu option at
PB #11 is shown, but not selectable. Scrolling off the air-to-air display is
not possible as long as the weapons select switch is in GUNS.

Text from AVI-2_MPD-MPCD_page_26.jpeg:
TAKE COMMAND FUNCTION

Some displays on the MPDs/MPCDs require that a crew member take
command of them for system operation. (You would not want two people
trying to move the A/A radar cursor at the same time, would you?) The
systems with the take command function are: air-to-air radar (A/A RDR),
air-to-ground radar (A/G RDR), targeting IR (TGT IR), tactical situation
display (TSD), VID 2, VID 5, VID 8, and data frame. Other display
formats, such as the ADI, HSI, etc., can be manipulated with the push
buttons by either crew member at anytime. Needless to say, some crew
coordination is required for take command actions.

Taking Command

The crew member desiring to operate a “take command” system must take
command of it; command cannot be given. To take command, use the
same switches used to sequence displays. First, you must have the system
display format showing on one of your MPDs/MPCDs. In the front
cockpit, momentarily depress and release the castle switch and, within
two seconds, move it toward the MPD/MPCD you want to command
(Figure D-16). If the other crew member is not using the display, you now
command it.

Once a crew member is in command of a displayed system, visual
indications of command status appear on the display. With the A/A RDR,
for example, the cursor becomes solid, and short “command” lines appear
between the legends on the bottom row of the display format. A display of
the same system in the other cockpit will have a dashed cursor and no
“command” lines (Figure D-18).

If you attempt to take command of a display that is actively being used, as
defined below, a SYSTEM IN USE cue comes up on your display

(Figure D-19). If you still want command, repeating the take command
actuation(s) a second time within five seconds gives it to you.

IN USE is defined as follows:
A/A RDR - the cursor is being moved or a target is designated.

A/G RDR - the cursor or elevation bar is being moved, UPDATE or

A/A or A/G RDR - when the HUD is in use for update or designation
functions. (This only appears if take command is initiated from the
RCP.)

Text from AVI-2_MPD-MPCD_page_30.jpeg:
Here is a limitation to remember about being in command. You cannot
command two displays simultaneously in the front cockpit or from one
hand controller in the rear cockpit. For example, if you are in command of
the A/G RDR format on the RCP right MPD with the TGT IR on the RCP
right MPCD, should you take command of the TGT IR, the A/G RDR will
go to neutral. (“Neutral” means that neither crew member is in command
of that system.) One exception exists in the FCP. In A/G master mode,
the pilot can be in command of the HUD and still fire the laser of the TGT
IR pod. Keep this in mind when you set up your cockpit display
programming. Also remember, the HOTAS switches are multifunctional.
The only way a HOTAS switch “knows” which system it is supposed to
affect is by “knowing” which system you “command.”

DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION

The multipurpose displays (MPDs) and multipurpose color displays
(MPCD) are cathode ray tubes (CRTs) which integrate the controls and
presentations of many aircraft systems into a single unit. The F-15E is
among the first aircraft to make such extensive use of these displays.
They provide the aircrew a unique flexibility to display the data being
gathered by on-board sensors and guided weapons and to arrange and
control this data to accommodate individual mission needs.

The MPD and the MPCD look essentially the same (Figure D-1). The face
of the unit consists of a 6" screen (MPD) or a 5" screen (MPCD)
surrounded by 20 peripheral push buttons by which the aircrew controls
systems and data to be displayed. The exact content of data in the display
formats is software programmable and stored within the operational flight
program (OFP) of the multipurpose display processor (MPDP), making
changes much easier to accomplish. The MPD presents all display
formats in monochromatic green. The MPCD also presents
monochromatic displays; in addition, it shows complex displays like the
electronic attitude director indicator (ADD and horizontal situation
indicator (HSI) in color, which aids in their rapid, accurate interpretation.
Color maps are used on the tactical situation display (TSD) for ease in
assessing the tactical situation.

In the aircraft, there are four MPDs, two in the front cockpit (FCP) and
two in the rear cockpit (RCP); and three MPCDs, one in the FCP and two
in the RCP as shown in Figures D-2 and D-3.
