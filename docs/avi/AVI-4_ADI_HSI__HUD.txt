Figure D - 3. ADI Symbology (Continued).

Heading Scale and Heading Indicator: The caret on the heading scale
indicates the current heading. If heading information is invalid, OFF is
written above the heading scale and the heading numbers are removed.
Heading information always comes from the INS unless an INS error is
detected, then the CC will use AHRS (EGI after TCTO 1F-15E-737)
heading.

True Airspeed or Ground Speed: True airspeed or ground speed is
displayed below the angle of attack/command velocity, when selected on
the UFC Data 1 format. If neither true airspeed or ground speed is
selected, the space is blank. If either true airspeed or ground speed is
selected but invalid, it is displayed as T OFF or G OFF.

AVI-4 D-4


Text from AVI-4_ADI_HSI__HUD_page_11.jpeg:
Bank Steering Bar: The bank steering bar provides command steering
information to intercept TACAN/ILS courses (set on the HSI), to steer
direct to navigation steer points, or to fly the ground track course on the
HSI. The function of the bank steering bar is dependent on the steer
mode selected on the HSI.

Pitch Steering Bar: A pitch steering bar appears when the aircraft
captures the glide slope (ILST or ILSN steer mode selected on the HSI).
The ILS pitch steering bar commands a 3° glide slope.

Radar Altimeter Thermometer/Scale: The analog radar altimeter
thermometer/scale is displayed in all master modes whenever the radar
altimeter is operating and the terrain following (TF) system is ON. The
thermometer is never displayed on the ADI during non-TF operations or
during TF operations with radar altimeter in OVERRIDE. During normal
TF operations it is displayed regardless of aircraft altitude (it is not
removed when the aircraft altitude is above 1500 feet AGL).

Attitude Sphere: The attitude sphere depicts the aircraft in relation to the
horizon. On a MPD, the ground is displayed as thick, closely spaced
horizontal lines while the sky is clear. On a MPCD the sky is blue and the
ground is brown lines.

Note: When the pitch attitude meets or exceeds +30°, the horizon line is
not visible and the sphere is all one color.

Radar Altitude: Radar altitude is displayed below the baro altitude (below
vertical velocity, if displayed) only if it is selected on the UFC Data 1
format. If radar altitude is invalid (and selected for display), it is
displayed as R OFF.

Vertical Velocity: Vertical velocity is shown under the barometric altitude
readout when the landing gear handle is down. It is displayed as feet per
minute, prefaced with a (+) for climbing or a (-) for descending. If invalid,
it is displayed as VV OFF. This space is blank when the gear handle is

up.

Baro Altitude: Barometric altitude is always displayed in the altitude
window (box). At 1000 feet MSL and above, the last three digits are small
and the preceding digits are large. Below 1000 feet, all three digits are
large. If the barometric altitude is invalid, OFF is displayed in the box.

D-5 AVI-4


Text from AVI-4_ADI_HSI__HUD_page_12.jpeg:
Command Heading Bug and Digital Readout: The command heading bug
(Figure D-4) indicates the heading to the next navigation sequence point if
NAV is the steer mode selected on the HSI. If ILST, ILSN, TCN, or HDG
is the steer mode selected on the HSI, the command heading bug is slaved
to the heading set on the HSI. If GT is the HSI-selected steer mode, the
bug provides a command heading to fly the HSI-set ground track. If it is
beyond the range of the scale, the bug is pegged at the appropriate edge
(left or right) with a digital readout beneath it.

Command velocity and the associated sequence point (Figure D-4) are
displayed (if valid and landing gear handle is up) when a time on target
(TOT) is assigned to a specific sequence point. This is the speed necessary
to reach the given sequence point at the TOT. The information displayed
is for the next sequence point (on the current route) that has a TOT
assigned.

Standby Instruments

Conventional instruments are located in both cockpits on the main
instrument panel (Figures D-6 and D-7). The angle of attack indicator
and the vertical velocity indicator require main generator power. The
airspeed indicator and altimeter do not require any power. All other
standby instruments function off main generator or emergency generator
power (auto or manual) except for the standby compass, which requires no
power. Lighting for all standby instruments requires main generator
power.

Angle of Attack (AOA) Indicator - Front Cockpit Only

The standby AOA indicator is driven by electrical signals from the AOA
probe. Units from 0 to 45 are displayed. An OFF flag is displayed if
electrical power is lost, data from the ADC is invalid, or if the indicator
has mechanically failed.

Standby Airspeed Indicator - Front and Rear Cockpits

The standby airspeed indicator operates directly from pitot-static
pressures. It consists of a rotation pointer on a fixed scale with marks
from 60 to 850 knots.

AVI-4 D-10


Text from AVI-4_ADI_HSI__HUD_page_17.jpeg:
Standby Attitude Indicator (ADI) - Front and Rear Cockpits

The ADI is a self-contained, electrically driven gyro-horizon instrument.
The gyro is caged by pulling the knob. Power should be applied to the
instrument for at least 1 minute before caging. The caged position is
approximately 4° nose up from the normal ground attitude and the gyro
will precess 4° nose down after uncaging. Do not turn the knob to lock the
gyro in the caged position. The gyro cages to the aircraft longitudinal axis
(wingline) and not to level flight (horizon), regardless of actual aircraft
attitudes. An OFF flag appears if there is a power loss to the indicator or
the gyro is caged.

Standby Altimeter - Front and Rear Cockpits

The altimeter operates directly from a static pressure source. Only the
setting on the FCP standby altimeter sets the barometric pressure for the
air data computer (ADC). This baro altitude is then used by other aircraft
systems, including the HUD and ADI displayed barometric altitude.

Vertical Velocity Indicator (VVI) - Front and Rear Cockpits

The VVI operates by electrical signals from the air data computer.
It displays vertical velocity on a 0 to 6000 feet per minute scale. An OFF
flag appears if electrical power is lost or the display is not valid.

Crew Coordination: As changes made to the HSI display in either cockpit
affect both cockpits, crew coordination may be required.

AVI-4 D-16


Text from AVI-4_ADI_HSI__HUD_page_23.jpeg:
Range Scale: The HSI displays five range scales (10, 20, 40, 80, and

160 nm) at the top right corner under RNG. The range is the distance
from the aircraft symbol to the perimeter of the compass card. Increase or
decrease the range by pressing PB #16 or #17, respectively. The distances
to the navigation position and TACAN station symbols within the compass
card are to scale. This is provided for ease of HSI interpretation.

The Lubber Line: The compass card rotates so that the aircraft heading is
always under the top of the lubber line.

TACAN and NAV Data: The TACAN data block (on the left) and the NAV
data block (on the right) are green and blue, respectively, on a MPCD.

The TACAN data block provides bearing and distance, and estimated time
en route (only) to the selected TACAN station. The NAV data block
provides bearing, distance, and estimated time en route (ETE) or
estimated time of arrival (ETA) information to the current navigation
steer point. If ETE is displayed on the UFC Data 1 page at PB #2

(Figure D-11), then ETA is displayed on the HUD and HSI NAV data
blocks. If ETA is displayed on the UFC, ETE is displayed on the HUD and
HSI NAV data blocks. Toggling the PB alternately selects ETE/ETA.

Text from AVI-4_ADI_HSI__HUD_page_24.jpeg:
Heading Marker and Command Heading: The heading marker (captain’s
bars) is moved around the compass card by means of the command
heading selections when HDG, ALG, TCN, ILSN, or ILST is the selected
steer mode. Command heading is increased or decreased by pressing

PB #1 or #2. The heading changes by 1° per push or 10° per second if the
button is held depressed. Additionally, you may enter a desired heading
into the UFC scratchpad and depress either button to transfer that
heading to the HSI command heading readout. In the NAV mode, the
heading marker is slaved to the wind-corrected heading to fly to the
selected steer point, so it may differ from the heading under the NAV
bearing pointer and the bearing in the NAV data block. In the GT mode,
the heading marker is slaved to the command heading to fly the selected
ground track.

Bearing Pointers: There are two bearing pointers. The NAV bearing
pointer, a hollow arrow with a hollow tail, is blue on a MPCD. The
TACAN bearing pointer, an arrowhead with a solid tail, is green.

ADF Symbol: A small lollipop symbol is displayed only when the ADF is
selected. It indicates the bearing of a transmitted UHF signal. ADF is
activated from the UFC UHF 1 submenu.

Navigation/Steering Modes

There are eight steering modes listed on the HSI display. They are TCN,
CRS, ILST, ILSN, GT, NAV, ALG, and HDG, and are selected by pressing
the desired mode pushbuttons. The mode selected becomes boxed.

TACAN (TCN

Selected Course: The selected course is displayed at the top right side of
the HSI (Figure D-12). PB #15 increases the course and PB #14 decreases
it. The desired course can also be input by typing it into the UFC
scratchpad and pressing either button.

Course (CRS)

This steer mode is equivalent to the existing TACAN steer mode, except
that the radial will be calculated to a steer point rather than a TACAN
station. In CRS steer mode, the range and bearing to the selected CRS
radial will be calculated. CRS steer mode will have the same display
options and features as TCN steer mode, including PLAN and CDI views.
PB #6 on the electronic horizontal situation indicator (EHSI) will default
to TCN at power up. Depression of PB #6 will box the selection at PB #6
(initially TCN). Subsequent depressions of PB #6 will toggle between
TCN and CRS. Another steer mode must be selected in order to unbox the
selection at PB #6 (Figure D-15).

the HSI. (The data block on the HUD will be different.) The course
deviation scale is 1.25° per dot. Full deflection represents 2.5° or greater
deviation. If the autopilot is engaged or the TFR is on, ILS is not a
selectable mode and both the ILST and ILSN options are removed from

the display.

Ground Track (GT)

The heading marker (captain’s bars) and CMD HDG readout are slaved to
the command heading required to maintain the selected ground track
(Figure D-16). Use PBs #14 and #15 to select the desired ground track.
The ground track diamond shows current aircraft ground track.

Figure D-17 shows a heading of 350° to maintain a ground track of 355°.
If crosswinds increase or decrease, the heading marker adjusts to the
heading necessary to maintain the ground track of 355°. If there is no
drift, the ground track diamond aligns with the lubber line. In that case,
the heading marker, lubber line, and ground track diamond would be
aligned and the CMD HDG readout and selected ground track would read
the same.

TACAN/NAV data blocks and bearing pointers are available in all HSI
steer modes.

Navigation (NAV)

Selecting NAV moves the command heading marker and CMD HDG
readout to highlight the wind-corrected heading to the selected steer
point. Both agree with the bearing in the NAV data block (no wind), or
differ from it by the amount of drift present (Figure D-18). The command
heading is shown at the top left side of the display. Aircraft course
(ground track) is shown at the top right of the display and agrees with the
ground track diamond (both change as the aircraft current
heading/ground track changes).

The legend “AUTO SEQ” is displayed below PB #18 and is boxed when
auto sequencing is enabled. Auto sequencing means that as the aircraft
passes the current navigation point (within 2 nm), the next navigation
point on the route automatically becomes the “new” current navigation
point and aircraft steering then transitions to the “new” point. AUTO
SEQ can be selected/deselected in any HSI steering mode.

Autonomous Landing Guidance (ALG)

The ALG mode provides an independent capability for approaches and
landings at any location. “ILS-like” steering cues are provided to a
designated point on the ground via a selected course and a computed 3°
glide slope. Deviations from the selected course and glide path are
displayed to the aircrew on the ADI, HSI, and HUD. From the NAV or
INST master mode, ALG (PB #5) is selected on the HSI (Figure D-19).

The aircrew then designates the ALG point, the intended touchdown
point, via A/G radar, target IR, HUD designation, or NAV designation.
Designations are covered in a later lesson. An inbound course is set at

PB #14 and the ALG algorithm plots a position 10 nm from the designated
point and marks it as the final approach fix (FAF). A rectangular runway
symbol, a tick mark to represent the FAF, and a final approach arrow will
be displayed on the HSI if PLAN is selected at PB #20. After the aircraft
reaches the FAF, the system will provide guidance to the runway based on
the specific course. Detailed information on the ALG mode is contained in
TO 1F-15E-1 and the system will be discussed further in A/G academics.

HUD
Function and Description

The wide field of view head-up display (WFOV HUD), 21° x 28°, provides
basic navigation, flight control, and weapons delivery information. A
difference from earlier F-15 HUD models is that airspeed and altitude

appear in digital formats. The displayed information generally matches
that on the ADI.

Text from AVI-4_ADI_HSI__HUD_page_40.jpeg:
Heading Scale: The heading scale presents a 30° readout across the top of
the display. The stationary heading caret indicates the aircraft magnetic
heading. If heading information is invalid, the numbers are removed and
OFF is displayed above the heading scale. Heading information always
comes from the INS unless it is determined to be invalid, in which case it
automatically switches to AHRS.

Command Heading/Steering Bug: The bug mirrors the command heading
on the HSI, if it is within the 30° scale. If not within the 30° heading
scale, it pegs on the appropriate side and a digital heading readout
appears below the bug. The command heading is aircrew selectable in the
TCN, ILS, and HDG steer modes. It is slaved to the computed heading to
fly to the current NAV steer point or to fly the selected ground track in the
GT steer mode, respectively (selections made from the HSI).

Airspeed: Calibrated airspeed is displayed in the box if valid. If invalid,
OFF is displayed.

AOA: The angle of attack data is displayed regardless of landing gear
handle position. If invalid, it is removed.

True Airspeed or Ground Speed: True airspeed or ground speed is
displayed if selected on UFC Data 1, and is prefaced by T or G, as
appropriate. T OFF or G OFF is displayed if selected but invalid.

Steering Bar: The steering bar gives bank steering to the selected
TCN/ILS course, the selected heading in the HDG steer mode, or the
current navigation steer point in the NAV steer mode. In GT steer mode
it provides bank steering to the HSI-programmed ground track. If
information is invalid, it is removed.

In Command Cue: Indicates the front cockpit is in command of the HUD.
Taking command of the HUD is required for certain updates/
designations, air-to-ground operations, and FLIR boresighting.

Mach Number: Current aircraft Mach, computed by the CC from ADC
inputs, is displayed when landing gear handle is up. Invalid information
is removed.

G Data: Current G is on the left and maximum allowable G is on the
right. G data disappears when the gear handle is down. Current G
followed by OWOFF (e.g., 2.2 G OWOFF) is displayed if maximum
allowable G is invalid. OWOFF is displayed if both current and maximum
allowable G are invalid.

AVI-4 D - 34


Text from AVI-4_ADI_HSI__HUD_page_41.jpeg:
Bank Angle Scale: The bank scale at the bottom of the HUD is graduated
with markings at 0, 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60°. If invalid, it is removed.

Pitch Ladder: The pitch ladder consists of the horizon bar and pitch lines.
Pitch lines are solid above the horizon bar and dashed below. Tabs at the
end of each line point toward the horizon. The pitch lines are numbered
in 5° increments up to 85° of pitch. They slant toward the horizon in the
center at one-half the pitch angle they represent (i.e., the 10° pitch line
slants 5° toward the horizon).

Normally, the pitch ladder is referenced to the velocity vector in both
azimuth and elevation. When the velocity vector becomes “pitch HUD
limited,” the pitch ladder will always be referenced to the valid velocity
vector while maintaining the artificial horizon on the horizon. If the
velocity vector is not displayed, the pitch ladder transitions to the aircraft
waterline in azimuth and displays best available pitch referenced to the
horizon. This transition may take up to 2 seconds, and is referenced for
pitch attitude only, not flight path. When the velocity vector reappears,
the pitch ladder transitions back to the velocity vector and references
flight path information once again.

Data Block: The data block displays data pertinent to the steer mode
selections made on the HSI. Upon selection of TCN, CRS, ILST, or ILSN,
“CSET XXX” flashes below ETE/A in the data block to remind the aircrew
to set the appropriate course. The cue is removed after 10 seconds. If
information is invalid, OFF is displayed on the appropriate line of the
data block. When CRS is the selected steer mode, CRS XX.XXX will be
displayed on the HUD, where XX.XXX designates the current steer-to
point. In addition, the NAV range to the selected steer point will be
displayed in nautical miles, along with time to go. CRS steer mode can be
autopilot coupled and ACRS XX.XXX is displayed. If the autopilot is
coupled, ANAV, ATCN, ACRS, AGT, or AHDG engaged cues will be
shown. If time is invalid, “OFFE” or “OFFA” is displayed.

Altitude: Barometric altitude is always displayed. If invalid, OFF is
displayed in the box. Radar altitude is displayed below the altitude box, if
selected on UFC Data 1. If invalid, it is displayed as R OFF.

Waterline Symbol: The waterline symbol displays aircraft pitch attitude.
The symbol flashes at 13° nose high, as a tail scrape warning cue, during
landing/aerobraking.

D - 35 AVI-4


Text from AVI-4_ADI_HSI__HUD_page_42.jpeg:
Velocity Vector (VV): This displays the instantaneous aircraft flight path
with respect to earth coordinates. The vertical relationship between the
waterline symbol and the velocity vector indicates true AOA. The VV
symbol is limited to 8.5° radius of motion centered on the HUD field of
view. It flashes when it reaches the limits of motion (due to wind
drift/crab). If in the instrument (INST) or navigation (NAV) master mode,
the VV may be caged to permit velocity vector referenced information
(pitch ladder and pitch/bank steering bars) to stay near the center of the
HUD when large yaw/crosswind angles exist. Take command of the HUD
and press the laser fire button (FCP only) on the throttle to cage the VV
and permit the pitch ladder and pitch/bank steering bars to be retained
near the center of the HUD. The velocity vector flashes when caged. A
subsequent laser fire button depression frees the symbol in drift.

NOTE: If the FNU INS fails, the velocity vector on the HUD will flash
continually. The EGI will drive the velocity vector in EGI PPKS. In all
other PPKS selections, the velocity vector will be driven by the air data
processor (ADP) as long as the airspeed exceeds 80 kts. When the
airspeed is less than 80 kts and the velocity vector is being driven by the
ADP, it will not be displayed.

Ghost Velocity Vector: When the VV is caged, a ghost vector (Figure D-26)
is displayed to show actual flight path. It looks like a velocity vector
without the interior circle. The vector flashes when within 1.5° of the
HUD edge.

Command Velocity Wiper: The command velocity wiper is displayed to
the left of the calibrated airspeed readout to indicate a difference between
current aircraft speed and command velocity when a TOT is programmed.
The symbol rotates up and down where 1° represents one knot of velocity.
A positive angle signifies more velocity is needed. The command velocity
is based on ground speed or true airspeed if selected on the UFC;
otherwise command velocity is based on calibrated airspeed.

Target Designation (TD) Box/Electronic Identification (EID): With an
air-to-air radar lock on, the TD box is displayed on the HUD in the A/A,
NAV, or INST master mode. If applicable, an EID cue is displayed inside
the TD box.

Line of Sight (LOS) Cue: The function of the LOS cue is to highlight the
position of the current navigation steer point when the point is located
within the HUD FOV.

Radar Altimeter Thermometer/Scale: The analog radar altimeter
thermometer/scale is displayed in all master modes whenever the radar
altimeter is powered and the radar altitude is less than or equal to 1500
feet AGL. The thermometer and scale are automatically removed when
the aircraft altitude is greater than 1800 feet AGL for more than 3
seconds and is displayed upon descent through 1500 feet AGL.

Gear Down Display

When the gear handle is down, HUD symbols (airspeed, AOA, altitude,
bank scale, etc.) are lowered to reduce pilot look angles between the
velocity vector and the symbols (Figure D-26). Mach and G data
disappear. Vertical velocity (VV) appears under the altitude window.
AOA continues to be displayed under the airspeed window.

HUD Repeater

The HUD repeater can be selected for display on any MPD/MPCD

(Figure D-27). To get NAV FLIR video, press PB #20 (N-F). To view HUD
camera video, press PB #16 (CAM). Figure D-26 shows a HUD display
with CAM selected. If neither video selection is made, the only display is
that of data and symbology (e.g., no “real world” camera or NAV FLIR
video). This is accomplished by pressing the boxed selection (“unboxing”

NAV or INST Master Modes

Both modes give similar flight information. The navigation data
(command heading bug, pitch/bank steering bars, CDI, and data block)
changes according to the steer mode selected on the HSI. The HSI steer
mode is mirrored in the HUD.

Upon selecting the TCN, CRS, ILST, or ILSN steer modes, “CSET” and

the current course set value appear (flashing) for 10 seconds following

STUDENT PREPARATION REQUIREMENTS

PRIOR TO THE CBT LESSON

1. Study the information contained in this workbook and complete the
End of Text Quiz.

2. Read references in Sections I and II of TO 1F-15E-1.

NOTE: This workbook includes references to TCTO 1F-15E-737
addressing global positioning system (GPS) aircraft modification data.
This capability is required to support the replacement of the TACAN,
VOR, and DME systems. The equipment is an embedded GPS/INS
system which combines both a GPS receiver and processor and an
independent ring laser gyro (RLG) INS into a single box that replaces the
attitude heading reference set (AHRS) and is called the EGI INS. The
existing INS is called the fighter navigation unit (FNU) INS. The EGI
provides a blended solution which optimizes navigation capability and
provides very accurate position and velocity data.

For this block of training, the most significant factor is that a new flight
director steer mode called course steering (CRS STR) has been added.
This steer mode is equivalent to the existing TACAN steer mode, except
that the course will be calculated to a steer point rather than a TACAN
station. It will have the same display options and features as TCN steer
mode, including PLAN and CDI views.

This workbook shows both existing and post-EGI/INS explanations.

ILST Steer Mode Data

When the ILST steer mode is selected on the HSI, the HUD data block
displays ILST and the selected TACAN channel and mode, TACAN range,
and ETE to the TACAN station (Figure D-32). MKR flashes below the
time when passing over the marker beacon cone.

The pitch and bank steering bars provide pitch and bank steering to
intercept the localizer course and glide path referenced to the velocity
vector. The course arrow displays localizer deviation with a full scale
deflection indicating 2.5° or greater (1.25° per dot).

The glide path indicator caret on the HUD, adjacent to the glide path
scale, functions the same as on the ADI. The command heading bug
reflects the command heading set on the HSI.

Figure D - 32. ILST (Gear Down).

NOTE: The ILS pitch steering bar is optimized for a 3° glideslope. If
flying a 2.5° glideslope, the pitch steering bar positions the aircraft about
% dot below glideslope at decision height. The ILS steering adjusts its
commands based on the elapsed time since glideslope capture. This
results in smaller correction commands as the aircraft gets closer to the
runway where the steering sensitivity increases. If the glideslope is
captured late or if there is any interruption of ILS validity after glideslope
capture, the steering may overcorrect and cause vertical and lateral
excursions during the approach.

Text from AVI-4_ADI_HSI__HUD_page_51.jpeg:
ILSN Steer Mode

Selecting ILSN on the HSI provides information similar to ILST except
that NAV range and time are displayed instead of TACAN data

(Figure D-33). In the HUD data block, ILSN steer mode, distance, and
estimated time en route (E) or estimated time of arrival (A) are presented.
Glide path information and steering to the ILS localizer remains the same
as ILST. In the ILS modes, vertical and lateral steering information is
provided by the ILS. Range information is provided by the INS or MN
(ILSN), or the TACAN (ILST).

Text from AVI-4_ADI_HSI__HUD_page_55.jpeg:
The aircrew can also program the HUD symbology independent of the
master mode and reject level selected on the HUD control panel. This
allows either crew member to change the HUD programming options in
flight without affecting the current master mode and HUD symbology.
Pressing PB #13 toggles to the next reject level and PB #14 toggles to the
next master mode.

There are several exceptions to the HUD display programming. They are:

1.

If the TFR is on, the radar altimeter thermometer and bank
angle scale are always displayed. The radar altimeter
thermometer is displayed only if allowed by altitude restrictions.

The bank angle scale is automatically displayed upon initial
activation of the TFR, whether programmed or not. It may,
however, be rejected in all of the master modes if TFR is in OFF
or STBY.

The bank steering bar will not be rejected when ILST or ILSN is
selected on the HSI.

The pilot can display the steer mode as range data, even if NAV
data has been programmed for removal, by moving the throttle
coolie switch outboard.

OWOFF is automatically displayed anytime an invalid
maximum G condition occurs.

A list of the symbols displayed with default selected is shown in master
mode HUD programming tables in TO 1F-15E-1. The aircrew can select
default on the HUD repeater to obtain the default HUD, “canned”
symbology. Alternatively, the pilot can select NORM on the HUD control
panel reject switch and achieve the “manufacturer’s standard” HUD
symbology.

DTM Read of HUD Programming Symbology

The capability to load customized HUD programs from the DTM is
available. The aircrew can load two customized HUD programs (i.e.,
REJ-1 and REJ-2) through the DTM for each master mode. Also, the
aircrew will see HUD PROG on the DTM format during DTM READ, as
shown in Figure D-37 (if HUD programming is included in the DTM load
program).

HUD Degrades/Failures and Interfaces

The CC commands the displays on the HUD through various controls and
generating interfaces. If the source of a display is sensed to be in a
degraded or failed mode (including OFF in most cases), the appropriate
invalid cue is commanded for that display data. Generally “OFF” is
displayed in place of the data, if it is invalid. Alternately, the data is
removed (command heading, CDI, pitch/bank steering bars). If the CC
fails and the MPDP has taken control, the HUD is in the backup mode.
The HUD display appears in the gear up position even with gear down.
The INS provides pitch and bank data and radar provides altitude. The
HUD format is only displayed on the HUD (no repeater display).
Degraded avionics in a later lesson addresses this subject in more detail.

ADI DISPLAY
Function and Description

The ADI (Figure D-1) provides basic attitude, heading, and airspeed
information. It can be displayed on any MPD/MPCD. The ADI
continuously displays calibrated airspeed, barometric altitude, magnetic
heading, and the current attitude source. In addition, pitch and bank
steering information (driven by signals from the CC) is displayed
referenced to the steering mode selection on the HSI. The ADI is also the
only source for turn and slip information.

Figure D - 2. ADI Symbology.

Calibrated Airspeed: The box always displays calibrated airspeed (or OFF
if calibrated airspeed is invalid).

Angle of Attack/Command Velocity: Angle of attack is displayed when the
landing gear is down. Command velocity is displayed when the landing
gear is up. The command velocity is normally in calibrated airspeed. If
true airspeed or ground speed is selected for display on UFC Data 1, the
command velocity is based on that speed. The navigation point/TOT on
which the command velocity is based is displayed after the command
velocity. If no TOT has been entered, command velocity is not displayed
and this space is blank.

Waterline Pitch Trim: Waterline pitch trim allows the adjustment of the
attitude sphere reference to the miniature aircraft symbol. Setting either
cockpit pitch trim for changing airspeeds/AOA sets the pitch reference in
both cockpits.

AVI-4 D-2


Text from AVI-4_ADI_HSI__HUD_page_9.jpeg:
Current Attitude Source (Before TCTO 1F-15E-737): The current attitude
source shows INS or AHRS. On power up, the source is AHRS until the
INS is aligned and NAV is selected on the INS control knob. Thereafter,
the source is INS unless the INS attitude is invalid; then the source will
default to AHRS. INS or AHRS can be manually selected by pressing

PB #5. Manually changing the attitude source has no effect on the
heading information source. If the current attitude source (displayed) is
invalid, OFF appears below the source legend and a large “X” is displayed
across the attitude sphere.

Current Attitude Source (After TCTO 1F-15E-737): Upon the installation
of GPS hardware, the AHRS is removed from the aircraft and the
selectable attitude references become EGI or (FNU) INS. The aircraft
central computer will determine whether the GPS hardware is installed
and hence determines the available selections at PB #5 (EGI/INS or
INS/AHRS). Ifthe selected source becomes invalid, the system should
default to the opposite source. In any case, if the selected source is
invalid, a large X will be displayed across the EADI, prompting the
aircrew to select the other attitude source. The INS is the power up
default source.

Flight Path Symbol: The velocity vector (bow tie) represents the flight
path vector with respect to pitch only.

Bank Scale and Pointer: The bank scale markings are in graduations at
10, 20, 30, 45, 60, and 90°. The pointer reflects actual bank angle. A scale
modification at 0, 45, and 60° clarifies bank limitations during terrain
following (TF) operation.

Slip Indicator, Turn Rate Scale and Indicator: The turn rate and slip rate
indicators are electronically displayed and electrically powered. If invalid,
OFF is displayed adjacent to the applicable indicator.

Miniature Aircraft: The miniature aircraft reflects actual aircraft attitude
in relation to the attitude sphere.

Pitch Scale: The pitch scale markings are in graduations of 5°, with each
10° increment numbered with the pitch angle.
