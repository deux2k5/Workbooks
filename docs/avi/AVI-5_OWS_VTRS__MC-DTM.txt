New Total Fuel Weights

At engine start, the CC does not immediately initialize the OWS to the
new total fuel weight. Rather, it starts at the previously stored shutdown
fuel weight and adds fuel at a rate of 40 pounds per second until reaching
the new fuel weight as displayed on the fuel quantity gauge. Depending
upon the amount of fuel at shutdown, the update process may take up to
10 minutes. During this time, the OWS indicates that it is operational,
but the maximum allowable G is not accurate.

NOTE

Whenever fuel quantity changes exceed the 40 pounds per second rate, (e.g.,
air refueling, high fuel consumption, tank jettison or ground refueling) the

OWS will be unreliable until computations catch up with the actual fuel
quantity.

AVI-5 D-4


Text from AVI-5_OWS_VTRS__MC-DTM_page_11.jpeg:
The correct fuel weight input to the OWS can be confirmed while
performing a BIT check of an MPD/MPCD during ground operations
(Figure D-3). From the main menu, press PB #20, BIT. On the BIT

display, press PB #18, MAINT. Then press PB #1, DSPL/UFC/EMD.

Finally, press PB #5, THIS DSPL.

The final display will have the total fuel reading at the bottom. The fuel
quantity displayed must be within 800 pounds of the total fuel reading on
the fuel quantity gauge. If the fuel input is out of tolerance, then this
indicates an unreliable OWS. To exit the display, press STOP, followed by
M (for menu).

A “DSPL/UFC/EMD” BIT initiated at PB #1 on the main BIT display
(Figure D-3) or AUTO BIT also displays the OWS computed fuel just as
THIS DSPL does, except that all MPD/MPCDs have the gray scale and
OWS fuel on them. To exit these BITs, press STOP on the FCP MPCD.
This clears all the displays of the gray scale.

External Load

For the OWS to function properly, the aircraft configuration must be
confirmed and/or programmed through the PACS display. Failure to
program the PACS correctly results in an inoperative or unreliable OWS.

To confirm correct PACS programming, access the armament menu from
any MPD/MPCD menu display by pressing PB #2, ARMT (Figure D-5).

There are several options available at this point; but, they are covered in
later PACS lessons. For now, the easiest technique for your first few
flights is to first confirm that PB #14 (A/A TRNG) and PB #15 (A/G
TRNG) are not boxed. If either is boxed, press PB #14/15 to deselect the
TRNG mode (Figure D-6). You want to confirm/program the actual
configuration, not a training configuration. Normally, air-to-air missiles
and external fuel tanks self-identify in PACS.

programming to "label" the centerline station as a fuel tank so that OWS
can work for you, which is verified by INVARM being removed from the
HUD. If unable to clear the INVARM from the OWS, have the crew chief
visually inspect ASP 72. If ASP 72 is orange, perform ASP 72 reset

procedures.

Referring to Figure D-12:

Row 1 of the OWS matrix display shows worst case overload data from
each column. The 103 (10.3 G) displayed in the ACC column shows the
highest G recorded, up to 12 Gs. Negative G forces, up to -4 Gs, are
displayed. Row 1 also indicates a 129% overload (OVL column). The
severity code 3 under WNG, row 1, is the highest listed in the WNG
column.

AVI-5 D-14


Text from AVI-5_OWS_VTRS__MC-DTM_page_21.jpeg:
Row 2 of the display shows latest overload data. In the figure, 7.8 G
resulted in a 105% overload of the computed maximum allowable G for the
wing. The severity code is 1 (severity codes listed in Figure D-12).

Rows 3-23 provide data for components. Three rows are assigned to each
component (i.e., FUS rows 3-5; WNG rows 6-8; etc.). If no recordable
overloads occur for a component, the rows are blank. If more than three
overload conditions have occurred for a component, only the three worst
conditions are displayed. Rows 6-8 indicate at least three overloads have
occurred on the wings; rows 9-11 indicate only two overloads have been
recorded for the left tail boom section. A severity code of 0 (WNG)
indicates that the load factor experienced was recordable but 100% or less
(>85%). An overload of 100.01 percent will cause the OVL to read 101 and
a severity code of 1 to be displayed.

Min/Max G is displayed in the lower right corner of the OWS display.
This readout reflects the lowest and highest G for the current mission.
Min/Max G are reset to 1 G during INS alignment and/or during OWS
reset (ASP reset).

D-15 AVL-5


Text from AVI-5_OWS_VTRS__MC-DTM_page_22.jpeg:
Clearing Overloads

If all the recorded overloads are 100% or less, they are cleared
automatically during INS alignment (when the INS mode knob is placed
to NAV). Any overload(s) exceeding 100% must be manually cleared,
which requires a coordinated air/ground crew action (Figure D-13). Either
aircrew member can select the OWS matrix display, press the CLEAR
button (CLR boxed), and then ensure that a maintenance person toggles
the OWS reset switch.

After reset, check that the matrix cleared, CLR is unboxed, and confirm
with maintenance that the ASP 72 status ball is now black instead of
orange. An orange ASP status ball on preflight indicates that the OWS
malfunctioned/failed a BIT or that an over G occurred on the previous
sortie.

Important Considerations

The OWS is not programmed to protect individual stores against over G or
to compute maximum allowable G for prohibited maneuvers (yaws greater
than 30° per second, spins, etc.).

At low altitudes and high airspeeds, rapid stick movement (full aft stick in
less than .5 second) can cause high G onset rates. While the OWS works
as designed, a high onset rate may cause serious structural overload
before a warning is given.

In the event of an OWS malfunction or other conditions causing
30 seconds of continuous voice warnings, the OWS shuts down and the

HUD displays only current G.

REMEMBER, ANYTIME THE HUD DISPLAYS ONLY
CURRENT G, NON-OWS G LIMITS MUST BE OBSERVED.

VIDEO TAPE RECORDER SET (VTRS)-3/4 INCH CASSETTE
Description

The VTRS is an onboard video tape recorder used by the aircrew to record
selected displays for post flight evaluation. The MPDs/MPCDs and HUD
displays, along with voice and aural tones, can be recorded automatically
under preset conditions (programmed recording) or manually
(nonprogrammed recording). The VTRS is powered as long as one main
generator is on-line.

Components and Controls

The VTRS uses a special format unlike VHS or BETA. It uses a *4-inch
cassette with a nominal recording time of 30 minutes. A cassette ready
for use has the tape wound on the spool without a colored center dot. The
video tape recorder is located under and aft of the left engine intake and is
accessed through a door near the centerline. The recorder (Figure D-15)
has two buttons labeled TAPE UNTHREAD and CASSETTE REMOVE.
Pressing the CASSETTE REMOVE button opens the cassette
compartment for inserting and removing the cassette.

selecting a display format that does have a “RCD” option at PB #12 (or
turn the VTRS to unthread).

NOTE

The presence of a CC clock time at PB #12 or on the HUD is not
100% assurance that the VTRS is recording. Only a green RCD

light on the FCP VTRS control panel is positive verification of
recording.

Programmed Recording

If you know in advance which display(s) you wish to record, you may
program this through the VTRS display. At a minimum, programmed
recording will then occur via HOTAS when either pickle button is pressed.

When you initially call up the VTRS submenu (Figure D-20), the last
programmed selections (display and option) are displayed. You may select
one or two of the eight options available by pressing the button next to the
option. A boxed priority number appears adjacent to the previously

@ A/A missile launch commanded by weapons release button (pickle
button) at weapon release through missile time of flight plus five
seconds.

@ GUN selected on weapon select switch and a designated radar target is
less than 10 nm.

Also, the AUTO function will command split-screen recording of the spin
recovery display (SRD) and the HUD when a spin occurs. Recording
continues for 30 seconds after RECOVER is displayed. Although the SRD
is shown on all displays, the VTRS selects the FCP left MPD for recording.

AVI-5 D - 30


Text from AVI-5_OWS_VTRS__MC-DTM_page_37.jpeg:
The AUTO function overrides other programmed or nonprogrammed
recording. The VTRS automatically switches to record the HUD (or HUD
and SRD in the event of a spin) until the AUTO conditions no longer exist.
Then the VTRS reverts to recording the previously
nonprogrammed/programmed display(s).

When the gun trigger is depressed to the 1st or 2nd detent, the VTRS also
records the HUD (nonprogrammed recording).

Recording In Progress Cue

Programmed recording in progress (Figure D-23) is indicated when the CC
clock time with an asterisk above and below is displayed on the right side
of the MPD/MPCD. The recording in-progress cue is not displayed on the

Split-Screen Recording

The VTRS has the capability to record split-screen video for the majority
of display format pairs (either nonprogrammed with the “RCD” push
button or trigger, or programmed with the STBY or RUN options). For
split-screen video to occur, the displays must be refreshed at the same
rate. Some of the display formats are ineligible for split-screen video due
to incompatible synchronization rates. If any two of the following formats
are selected, only the first one selected (or the one assigned priority 1, for

Preventing Inadvertent Recording (3/4-Inch Cassette Only)

If the previous crew did not terminate recording before aircraft shutdown,
recording is enabled when the INS is turned on. The amplified preflight
checks call for the “Video Tape Record Switch” to be in the “UNTHREAD”
position (Figure D-24). This will prevent inadvertent recording when the
INS is turned on.

Voice Communication and Aural Tones

In order to aid correlation of in-flight occurrences with postflight review of
the video tape recording, voice communications to, from and between the
crew members are recorded on the audio track of the VTRS. Likewise,
aural tones, voice warnings, weapon consent and weapon release tones are
recorded. (The weapon consent/release tones are not heard by the crew
members in the cockpit.)

VIDEO TAPE RECORDER SET (VTRS)-8MM CASSETTE
Description

The VTRS is an onboard video tape recorder used by the aircrew to record
selected displays for post flight evaluation. The MPDs/MPCDs and HUD
displays, along with voice and aural tones, can be recorded automatically
under preset conditions (programmed recording) or manually
(nonprogrammed recording). The VTRS is powered as long as one main
generator is on-line.

Components and Controls

The 8mm VTRS uses 8mm tape cassettes that allow for up to 5 hours of
recording. The 8mm VTRS system consists of a video color tape recorder
and a power panel that are mounted in the rear cockpit on the left console
forward of the throttles and hand controller (Figure D-27).

Power Panel

The power panel has a three-position (OFF, ON and PLAYBACK) toggle
switch. The ON position supplies power to the 8mm VTRS system.
PLAYBACK is not available at this time. ON must be selected in order for
the system to function. (PLAYBACK will provide power to the recorder
also.)

Text from AVI-5_OWS_VTRS__MC-DTM_page_45.jpeg:
The power light illuminates when both power switches are in the ON
position. The EJECT button provides a means of opening the door for
inserting/removing the cassette. Both power switches must be in the ON
position for the EJECT feature to work.

There is a protective cover over the remaining controls on the recorder.
The cover simply slides back to provide access to the controls.

Starting from the left of the recorder, the first control is the STOP button
( ). Pressing it-will terminate the function selected. Next is the REW
(rewind) button ( ). Pressing and holding men will rewind the
cassette. The next control is the PLAY button ( ©). If PLAYBACK were
available, pressing the PLAY button wouldallow for viewing of the
cassette. The FF (fast forward) button ( é) ) is the next control.
Pressing and holding this button will fast-forward the tape.

The PAUSE button ( ) is the next control. Pressing this button will
pause the tape. Pressing the button a second time allows for the
resumption of the previous function. If you press one of the other control
buttons, that function is selected. There is a PAUSE light to signify when
the recorder is in the pause mode. There is a 5 minute counter on the
PAUSE button. With REC and PAUSE selected, both will automatically
deselect after 5 minutes. The REC (record) switch is the next control.
Sliding the switch to the right and releasing it selects the record mode for
the recorder. The REC light comes on when REC is selected and there is
tape remaining.

Below those controls are several features/options:
@ The AUDIO MONITOR button is not used.

@ Tape speed is selected with the SP/LP button. Pressing the button
alternatively selects Slow Play (SP) or Long Play (LP) speed. Based on
the cassette used, the system will record up to 5 hours with Long Play
selected or 2.5 hours with Slow Play selected. If time is not factor, the
Slow Play will give higher quality recording than the Long Play option.

@ The COUNTER RESET button permits resetting the tape counter to
0:00:00.

D - 39 AVI-5


Text from AVI-5_OWS_VTRS__MC-DTM_page_46.jpeg:
There is also a display window that permits confirmation of features
selected.

@ MAIN/L, SUB/R and STEREO are not used.
@ OUT is displayed when PLAY is selected on the video recorder.

e@ IN is displayed when STOP, FF, REW, REC or PAUSE is selected on
the video recorder.

@ SL/LP indicates which tape speed has been selected.

@ Tape Counter indicates the tape time in hours, minutes and seconds.
A BATTERY RELEASE switch is located on the side near the EJECT
button (it is not used). BATTER WARNING INDICATOR (in the display
window) is also not used. DEW INDICATOR flashes in the display

window when there is moisture inside the recorder. The recorder should
be allowed to dry out before use.

Video Recorder Setup

After main generator power is available, the ON position on the power
panel should be selected. The video recorder power switch should then be
moved to the ON position. Moving the EJECT switch to the right will
open the door to permit the cassette to be inserted into the recorder.
Gently push the door to the close position. Sliding the REC switch to the
right initiates recording. Without record commands from the VTRS
display and without RCD (PB #12) buttons selected, the recorder records
the HUD (without symbology) and cockpit audio.

Several options exist for day to day operation of the recorder. Based on
the length of the tape used and the tape speed selected, there should be
sufficient tape to select REC prior to takeoff and tape the entire flight.
During the mission use either programmed or manual (PB #12/trigger)
recording to tape the desired events. During debrief, this could require a
bit of searching to locate the desired events.

AVI-5 D - 40


Text from AVI-5_OWS_VTRS__MC-DTM_page_47.jpeg:
Another option is to command either programmed or nonprogrammed
recording and then select REC just prior to the events to be taped. After
the event is completed, PAUSE or STOP will cease recording. Pressing
PAUSE a second time (if PAUSE was used to stop recording) will re-
initiate recording. If STOP was used, sliding the REC switch to the right
will initiate recording again. If either or both power switches are used to
terminate recording, the power switches must be returned to the ON
position and REC selected again to start recording. Although the recorder
is capable of recording color images, the equipment in the aircraft will not
permit color recording.

The cassette must be removed prior to both main generators going off-line.
Otherwise, an external power unit will be required to eject the cassette.

Operation

Nonprogrammed, programmed and split-screen recording are
accomplished the same with the 8mm cassette and the 3/4-inch cassette.
The recording in-progress cue, weapon consent/release cue, and voice
communication and aural tones are also displayed/heard under the same
conditions while using the 8mm cassette. (Refer to the Nonprogrammed
Recording, Programmed Recording, Recording In Progress Cue, Split-
Screen Recording, Weapon Consent/Release Cue, and Voice
Communication and Aural Tones sections on pages D-25 through D-36 of
this workbook.)

Preventing Inadvertent Recording (8mm Only)

Prior to turning the recorder on and initiating recording, check the VTRS
display to confirm that programmed and/or nonprogrammed recording of
any displays have not been commanded. If there is an asterisk by a
display, then that display is being commanded to record. If programmed
recording has been commanded (RUN is selected), select STBY or OFF.

If there is an asterisk by a display after confirming that STBY or OFF is
selected, then nonprogrammed recording has been commanded. Go to
that display, select a display with a format that normally has the “RCD”
option at PB #12 (radar, ADI, HSI, etc.). PB #12 will display the CC clock.
Select PB #12, “RCD” will be displayed and nonprogrammed recording
will terminate.

D-41 AVI-5


Text from AVI-5_OWS_VTRS__MC-DTM_page_48.jpeg:
In order for the recorder to record a display, the REC light must be on and
either programmed or nonprogrammed recording must be commanded. If
the REC light is on, both power switches are in the ON position and REC
has been selected. The video recorder cannot be in the record mode upon
starting the engines. If it loses power while in the record mode, i.e., the
engines are shut down, the record mode is deselected.

If the REC light is not illuminated on the recorder, the system is not
recording. Displays can be in the record mode but will not be recorded
unless the REC light is on. Bottom line: to record a display, the REC light
must be on and recording must be commanded by either the VTRS
display, PB #12 or the trigger/weapons release switch.

HUD TITLING

Changes in the title, if required, are made through the UFC via the
keyboard and the associated option push button. Leading zeros are not
required. The day can be changed by typing in one or two digits. The
month is changed by typing in the month (one or two digits) plus the “-“
and the day (one or two digits). Mission type changes can be entered as
one or two digit numbers. Tail number changes require the entire set of
characters to be typed, for example, 87-0188. The year is entered using
only the last two digits.

Location 1 and 2 (LOC-1 and LOC-2) are undefined buffers. They are
used locally for the squadron number and the pilot/WSO numbers (e.g.,
Pilot-01, WSO-02). Only those items that are different from those
previously programmed must be entered.

LOC-1 = 0333 (Squadron number)
LOC-2 = 0102 (Pilot/WSO numbers)

MISSION CARTRIDGE (MC)/DATA TRANSFER MODULE (DTM)
Description

Prior to TCTO 1F-15E-700, the DTM provides the means to transfer
mission data from the AFMSS to the aircraft. It also provides for
transferring operations data from the aircraft back to the AFMSS and
maintenance data from the aircraft to the computerized fault reporting
system (CFRS).

After TCTO 1F-15E-700, the MC will be the primary means of
transferring mission data from the AFMSS to the aircraft and for
transferring operations data from the aircraft to the AFMSS. The DTM
can continue to be used for this function if the MC is not available or
malfunctioning. If the MC is used, the DTM and MC can be used for
transferring mission data to the aircraft and back to the AFMSS. The
DTM will continue to be the means for transferring maintenance data
from the aircraft to the CFRS.

If the MC is utilized, the DTM can be either an ops or maintenance DTM.
The computer in the aircraft recognizes the DTM as either ops or
maintenance from the structure of the information on the DTM. If the
DTM is loaded via AFMSS, it is loaded with a directory structure that
identifies it as an ops DTM. Maintenance DTMs are not normally used on
the AFMSS, therefore a directory structure is not loaded on the DTM. If
an ops DTM is erased, the directory structure is erased and the computer
sees it as a maintenance DTM.

The problem in the past has been the classification of the ops DTM. With
the MC being used as the means to transfer mission data, the
maintenance DTM can be used to transfer the unclassified maintenance
data from the aircraft to the CFRS. The CC knows that it is a
maintenance DTM and will block the transfer of classified data to the
maintenance DTM, thus allowing the transfer of unclassified data to
CFRS.

The MC is inserted into the MC receptacle on the right console in the rear

cockpit. The DTM is inserted in the DTM receptacle on the right
instrument panel in the front cockpit.

OVERLOAD WARNING SYSTEM (OWS)
Description

The OWS gives the crew warnings that the maximum allowable G is being
approached or has been exceeded. The OWS provides:

@ A900 Hz intercom tone at 85% maximum allowable G (or 1 G below
maximum allowable, whichever is lower), interrupted at a 4 Hz rate to
produce a slow/single rate beeping sound.

@ A900 Hz intercom tone at 92% maximum allowable G, interrupted at
a 10 Hz rate to produce a fast/double rate beeping sound (about twice

the initial rate).

@ A voice warning heard at 100% maximum allowable G (“OVER G,
OVER G”).

@ A stored record of overloads at or above 85% maximum allowable G.

Operation

The OWS is a central computer (CC) software program and as such, there
is no OWS black box. The OWS receives and distributes data as shown in

Figure D-1.
EXCEEDANCE
ADC / ADP FUEL QTY

Ows
MPD/MPCD ones Gite
WARNING)
AVI-05-01
Figure D - 1.

@ Inputs are processed by the CC and displayed on the HUD as current
G and maximum allowable G.

@ Overloads are stored in the CC memory and can be displayed on the
MPD/MPCD OWS matrix display.

The OWS is available as long as one main generator is on-line to power
the CC. Any input system failure or malfunction results in the OWS
shutting down or becoming unreliable. For example, if AIU 2 fails, OWS
computations will not be made. Other input malfunctions such as ADC
failure, fuel quantity malfunctions or trapped external fuel will render the
OWS unreliable. In these cases, comply with the TO 1F-15E-1 non-OWS
G limits.

There is no OWS Built-In Test (BIT) because the avionics that provide

inputs to the system have their own BIT. OWS operation is verified by
ensuring that:
