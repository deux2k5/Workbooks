HQ II

HQ II radios have an expanded memory board (EMB) added to the radio.
The nonvolatile memory, i.e., memory that is not erased when power is
removed, allows HQ II to store additional information without using the
radio’s channel storage area. Not only does the EMB make channels
15-19 available for normal UHF operation, but it also increases the
amount of information that can be stored. The training frequencies
previously limited to 5 by basic HQ are increased to 16 stored on the EMB.
This increases the number of training nets to sixteen (vice five) providing
more flexibility and deconfliction.

To provide compatibility with basic HQ users, HQ II radios can also enter
WOD elements in preset channels 15-20, using basic HQ procedures.

With HQ II, frequency managed training net frequencies are stored in the
HQ II radio’s expanded memory board. The WOD element in preset
channel 20 performs mode selection and hop rate, but the frequencies in
preset channels 19-15 are not used for HQ operations—only initialization.
You will normally use this option in your day-to-day training.

Regardless of whether you operate in basic HQ or HQ II mode, HQ II
radios are initialized for HQ operation by rotating the channel selector
backwards from channel 20 to channel 15 to “load” the WOD.

Multiple Words-of-the-Day (WOD)

Another advantage of HQ II increased memory is the capacity to store and
retrieve up to six days WODs, referred to as multiple WODs (MWOD).
The selection of the next day’s WOD from the available MWODs is done
through a “date tag” loaded with each WOD. To use the WOD that
corresponds to a specific date, the radio must be told the current day of
the month manually or through an encoded time-of-day (TOD) signal with
the date appended. In the near future, a GPS signal could make WOD
selection for the current day automatic at power up on start.

The HQ II capability to store six WODs and automatically reset itself to

the next day’s WOD when it recognizes 2400Z has eliminated one of basic
HQs shortfalls.

AVI-6 D-4


Text from AVI-6_Have_Quick_and_KY-58_page_11.jpeg:
Time-of-Day (TOD)

While HQ radios are in the anti-jam (AJ) mode they are continuously
hopping through frequencies. (Anti-jam operation is also known as
“active” mode because the radio is actively changing frequency.) To
ensure that all radios start together and hop to each new frequency
simultaneously, a method of synchronization is required. The TOD signal,
commonly referred to as a “Mickey,” is used to provide coordinated
hopping. TOD information is transmitted by a data-burst message 1/4
second in duration on any UHF frequency.

The TOD message contains Universal Coordinated Time (time-of-day) and
may contain date information (day-of-month). The date information
applies only to HQ II radios. After the radio is turned on it accepts the
first TOD signal it “hears,” regardless of what frequency or channel it is
on.

There are three possible sources for a TOD. The first method is via the
AN/TRC-187 or the older AN/TRC-177 time signal set. This is the
preferred and most accurate source for a TOD. These are the standard
TOD generators located in the command post or within radio maintenance
at most bases. The AN/TRC-187 timing is coordinated via satellite with
other TOD generators around the world and is accurate to nanoseconds
per month.

The second source of a Mickey is from another HQ user. Anyone using HQ
can pass their TOD to you. Though it is not as accurate as the TOD
generator, it gives an acceptable time and allows the users of that common
TOD to converse. This method is usually used by C® assets, AWACS,
ABCCC, a flight leader or the mission commander for a specific package.

The final method of getting a Mickey is to self-generate the TOD. This
method synchronizes your radio with no one else (until you pass along
your TOD) but may have application if operating out of a remote location
or if the base TOD generator is inoperative. This procedure allows a flight
leader to self-start his radio and then pass his TOD to other flight
members. It is possible to send or receive a TOD on both normal and
active modes.

Self-generated TODs may be fine for short training sorties, but are not
accurate enough to be used by a large cross section of aircraft.
Communication with aircraft using TOD generator signals would be
impossible, because their TODs would be different.

D-5 AVI-6


Text from AVI-6_Have_Quick_and_KY-58_page_12.jpeg:
The TOD is passed as a two-tone BEEP-BOOP when generated by another
aircraft. The first tone is higher pitched than the second and is where the
encoded message lies.

The TOD is stored in the radio on which it was received and must be
obtained at the beginning of each flight. It is different from the VHSIC
CC clock time and lost at power down. The F-15E cannot currently obtain
a time-of-day for HQ from the GPS satellite system.

The HQ system can “drift” during flight, resulting in garbled
communications. There are procedures available to check the amount of
drift to determine if system maintenance is required; refer to the TAWC
HAVE QUICK handbook for specific information.

Net

A net is a coded signal used for synchronized frequency hopping during AJ
operation. Nets provide deconfliction when a large number of players
wish to use anti-jam communication. The net number determines the
order in which the radio hops among the frequencies loaded by the WOD
elements or stored in the EMB and radio channel memory storage.
Currently there are four basic types of nets available for basic HQ. These
are training nets, A-nets, sectionalized A-nets and B-nets (AWACS
communications) for combat. HQ II radios can use all four types of basic
nets.

Three additional types of nets are available for HQ II use only. They are
frequency managed NATO (FMA-nets), frequency managed non-NATO
(FMA-nets) and frequency managed training nets (FMT-nets). FMA-nets
provide 1000 nets for NATO use and an additional 1000 nets for non-
NATO countries. HQ IT FMT-nets provide an additional 16 nets for use in
training.

A-nets and FMA-nets are for combat only, and are jam resistant. Four
MHZ frequency separation is guaranteed. During normal peacetime
operations, only the training modes (T-nets and FMT-nets) are used.
During Red Flags and other similar exercises, the combat mode may be
used. The following discussion is limited to training nets (T-nets and
FMT-nets).

Training Net Selection

UHF frequencies containing net numbers are used to tell the HQ radio
which net to operate on. The frequency is 30b.b cc for a training net. The

AVI-6 D-6


Text from AVI-6_Have_Quick_and_KY-58_page_13.jpeg:
digits b.b contain the net number. Net 01 is selected with frequency 0.0,
and net 02 with frequency 0.1, etc.

The digits cc tell the HQ II radio to operate in basic HQ or HQ II training
mode. The digits cc are either 00 or 25. A training net number ending in
00 tells the radio to use a basic HQ T-net. A training net number ending
in 25 tells the radio to use HQ II FMT-net. To select T-net 2, AJ is
selected with the radio set to frequency 300.1 00. To select FMT-net 13,
AJ is selected with the radio set to frequency 301.2 25.

The frequencies that define T-nets or FMT-nets are not WOD elements,
and may be preset as a channel or selected as a normal manual frequency.
They are usable as normal UHF frequency in “plain” UHF operation and

select a net as described below in anti-jam operation.

Basic HQ T-Nets

Basic T-nets can be used by a basic HQ radio or a HQ II radio using basic
procedures. The WOD element frequencies entered in preset channels
15-19 storage are the frequencies used by the five basic T-nets. They are
the frequencies the radio hops through during HQ operations.

The nets are numbered 1-5 and are selected by switching to the
frequencies 300.000 - 300.400 on the appropriate radio. 300.000 is net 1,
300.100 is net 2, etc. If 300.500 is selected, it uses the same frequencies
as 300.000 (net 1); 300.600 uses the same as 300.100 (net 2), etc. (Table D-
1). The 00 in the hundredths and thousandths position distinguish these
nets as basic HQ T-nets to a HQ II radio. Since channel memory is used
for basic HQ WOD storage, preset channels 15-19 are not available to
channelize a T-net as one of the radio’s preset frequencies.

Text from AVI-6_Have_Quick_and_KY-58_page_14.jpeg:
HQ II T-Nets (Nonvolatile Memory)

With HQ II radios, the frequencies the radio uses to hop among during
HQ operations can be preset in channels 15-19 (basic operations) or they
can be stored in HQ II nonvolatile memory (KEMB). The coded frequencies
that are loaded as WOD elements through channels 15-19 using HQ II
procedures are the frequencies used in the five T-nets. The nets are
numbered in the same manner as basic HQ nets. If basic HQ operation is
not desired, channels 15-19 do not need to contain WOD elements and
may be used for normal UHF operation when the radio is transmitting in
the “plain” mode of operation, i.e. anti-jam operation not selected.

HQ II FMT-Nets

For training purposes, HAVE QUICK II provides 16 FMT-nets in addition
to the five T-nets already in the HQ system. To use the FMT-nets, 16
training frequencies must be loaded into the radio EMB. Unlike the T-net
frequencies, these frequencies (provided later in this workbook) are not
part of the training WOD.

The nets are numbered 1-16 and are identified by the frequencies 300.025
- 301.525 (300.025 is FMT-net 1, etc.). A WOD must be loaded in order to
use the FMT-nets (See Table D-2). The suffix 25 identifies these nets as
HQ II FMT-nets to the HQ II radio.

The FMT-net frequencies may be used as “plain” UHF channelized or
manual frequencies in normal UHF mode or to select a net in anti-jam
mode.

Text from AVI-6_Have_Quick_and_KY-58_page_15.jpeg:
Normal Operation

Normal anti-jam operation of Have Quick radios requires preparation of
the radio and selection of the anti-jam mode with common codes for the
participating radios. A basic HQ radio requires the crew or maintenance
personnel to channelize the WOD elements in channels 15-19 as well as
an initialization code in the WOD element stored in channel 20. WOD
elements are usually preset by maintenance or read to the radio by DTM
transfer. These elements may not be changed without requiring the
channels to be reprogrammed prior to the next HQ use.

If HQ II training nets (FMT-nets) are to be used the channel storage area
information may be used for normal UHF channels since it is not used for
anti-jam operation. Maintenance or, on rare occasions, the aircrew must
enter the training net frequencies to the EMB prior to net selection.

On every sortie that uses HQ the crew must “load” the WOD to the radio
by cycling the rotary channel selector knob backwards from channel 20 to
15. For basic HQ, this initializes the radio and loads the WOD elements.
HQ II operation requires this same set of actions, i.e., cycling the rotary
channel selector knob 20-15, to initialize the radio.

A time synchronization signal known as a TOD must be received by the
radios to enable simultaneous hopping. The signal may be externally or
internally generated. External TODs are normally received on a UHF
channel or frequency reserved for a dedicated TOD generator broadcasting
continuously. A second party may retransmit a TOD received from a TOD
generator, a third aircraft or one that was self-generated. A radio can
start its own clock without receiving another TOD, and then pass that
reference to others. The radio will accept the first TOD it hears
transmitted immediately after turn on. Additional TODs require putting
the radio in a mode to receive a TOD and tuning to the frequency where it
will be broadcast. Once a TOD is received the HQ has the time of day
reference to synchronize with other radios using the same time signal
reference.

D-9 AVI-6


Text from AVI-6_Have_Quick_and_KY-58_page_16.jpeg:
To initiate HQ anti-jam operation the crew must select a net of common
frequencies and mode of operation by identifying the HQ net in the form of
a plain UHF frequency. The frequency convention is identified by
changing the “frequency” of the UHF to the net code manually or by
selecting a channel that contains the net. Finally, select anti-jam (AJ on
the UFC UHF submenu). If you are successful, when the microphone is
keyed a faint ticking will be heard as the radio channel hops.

Alert and Warning Tones

Alert and warning tones are heard in your headset when the HQ radio
identifies a problem within its system. Generally speaking, if a steady
tone is heard when HQ operation is attempted, no WOD and/or TOD
information is loaded. If an interrupted tone is heard, an incorrect net is
in use. When troubleshooting a HQ problem, rule out the obvious first.
Did you load the WOD properly? Did you get a TOD? Was it a good TOD?
Did you load the WOD and get the TOD on the same radio? Do you have
the correct net selected? Are you on manual versus a preset? If the
answer to all these questions is yes, you should reload the WOD, get
another TOD and re-check the net frequency. If HQ still does not work,
you might try HQ on the other radio.

HAVE QUICK and the F-15E

So far this discussion of HQ has been general in an attempt to help you
develop an understanding of the basics of HQ. Next is a description of
F-15E equipment used to operate HQ and the procedures that enable you
to work the system. During the discussion bear in mind local HQ
operations are normally limited to UHF 2 using HQ II FMT-nets, i.e. the
expanded memory board frequencies.

Upfront Control (UFC) Displays and Switchology

HQ use begins with the UHF submenu, either UHF 1 or UHF 2. At
Seymour Johnson AFB, daily training sorties would use the UHF 2

submenu and UHF 2 channel selector. PB #1 is the ON/OFF power switch

for the radio. PB #1 is also used in conjunction with presetting
frequencies within that radio. PB #38, AJ, selects/deselects the HQ

anti-jam mode. PB #5 and PB #6 are used to enter manual frequencies for
UHF 1 and 2. PB #8, TOD, enables the radio to accept the next TOD

generated. PB #10 is used in conjunction with changing preset

frequencies (Figure D-1).

WOD Load

After the DTM has completed data transfer, rotate the UHF channel
selector knob from channel 20 to channel 15 one channel at a time to load
the WOD. Preset frequency operation must be selected, i.e., the asterisk
must appear next to the channel selector knob. As each channel is
selected, a single beep should be heard. When channel 15 is selected, a
double beep should be heard. The double beep indicates that the WOD
has been loaded.

In normal UHF operation, channel 20 is reserved for both basic HQ and
HQ II WOD initialization. Do not rotate to channel 20 unless you desire
to reload the WOD.

As preset channel memory is used for basic HQ WOD storage, channels
15-20 are not available for normal use during basic HQ AJ operation. HQ
II operations using FMT-nets and the frequencies contained in expanded
memory do not require WOD elements programmed in channels 15-19.
These elements are only required when HQ II radios are operated in basic
HQ mode for compatibility with non-HQ II users. (Cycling channel 15-19
is still necessary to initialize the radio for either mode of operation.)
Except for basic HQ operations, HQ II channels 15-19 may be used for
normal (non-HQ) operations.

Tone Switch

The tone switch is located in both the front cockpit (remote
intercommunications control panel) and rear cockpit
(intercommunications set control panel). This switch allows you to
self-generate a tone for your TOD, or to pass your TOD (regardless of the
source (self-generated or from an outside source)) to another aircraft. It
also allows you to load frequencies into nonvolatile memory for HQ II
operations. The switch is spring loaded to the center position. Forward
works with UHF 1, while aft performs the same operations for UHF 2
(Figure D-2). The HQ II function of this switch is determined by the last
command code entered into the radio.

Receiving the TOD

The TOD is normally received on the preset channel or manual frequency
of the TOD generator. It may be self-generated by the flight lead and
passed to the flight using a discrete frequency assigned on the flying
schedule. This frequency is scheduled to deconflict individual flight
FMT-nets and serves as a discrete aux (“plain”) frequency while airborne
if AJ ops are not desired.

To receive the TOD, first select the UHF submenu for the UHF that
contains the WOD and set the radio to the frequency (manual or preset)
on which the TOD will be transmitted. Then depress PB #8 adjacent to
“TOD” (Figure D-3). This places an asterisk by PB #8 for one second and
allows the radio to accept a TOD for a period of up to one minute. This is
not necessary for the first TOD after radio turn on as the radio accepts the
first TOD it hears. If the TOD is received, you hear the beep-boop tone.

Self-Starting the TOD

When a tone generator is unavailable and there is no other aircraft with a
valid Mickey, an individual aircraft can start its own clock. This TOD will
be synchronized only to other users to whom the TOD is subsequently
passed.

AVI-6 D-14


Text from AVI-6_Have_Quick_and_KY-58_page_21.jpeg:
To accomplish a self-start TOD, select the UHF submenu and hold the
tone switch to the appropriate radio position. While holding the tone
switch, depress PB #8 (Figure D-3) on the UFC and listen for a single
beep.

HAVE QUICK Anti-Jam (AJ) Operation

After the WOD and TOD have been loaded, anti-jam operation on UHF 2
is initiated as follows:

Select manual, type the net frequency in the scratchpad and enter at
PB #6. Figure D-4 indicates that FMT-net number 5 has been
selected. You may also have the net frequency preset in a channel. In
that situation, you would select the preset channel instead of going to
the manual frequency. Ensure the manual frequency or channel has
an asterisk indicating which is selected.

Clear the scratchpad, select the UHF 2 submenu, and press PB #3
adjacent to AJ. Selecting AJ places the radio in narrow band (NB
appears adjacent to PB #9), and initiates anti-jam channel hopping.

RV - RV (Receive Variable) is one of the two normal
operating modes (OPR being the other), and stars (*) when
selected. RV allows entry of different variables (1-6) into the
KY-58. The desired variable number is typed into the
scratchpad and entered at PB #8. Although either RV or
OPR can be used, all members of the formation must be on
the same operating mode (RV or OPR) and fill number (if
using RV). Select RV, if desired.

DELAY - The DELAY submode is enabled when using either
OPR or RV and can be selected (starred) at PB #9. DELAY
increases the interval between the time the transmitter is
keyed and the beep tone is heard (beep tone indicates system
is ready to transmit).


Text from AVI-6_Have_Quick_and_KY-58_page_33.jpeg:
PB #8 FILL - Fill numbers (1-6) can be entered at PB #8. Fill
numbers allow the user secure operation on six different
KY-58 nets that provide deconfliction when many players are
using secure speech at the same time. Those users with one
fill number do not interfere with those with another fill
number.

NOTE
Although you may enter fill numbers at PB #8 when operating in either
OPR or RV, they are not actually used by the system until RV is selected.

PB #4/7 U1/U2 - Either UHF radio may be selected for KY-58
operation; however, KY-58 operations may only be conducted
on one UHF radio at a time. The legend KY is displayed
after the radio legend (i.e., U1, U2) at PB #4 or #7 to indicate
which radio is selected for KY-58 operation. Additionally, the
appropriate radio legend is starred.

PB #38 BB/DP - Two operating submodes, baseband (BB) and
diphase (DP) are selectable at PB #3. Although either
submode is available for use, all members of the formation
must be operating on the same submode.

PB #2 PLAIN/CIPHER - When PLAIN is selected, the UHF radio is
operating normally and is not secure. When CIPHER is
selected, the radio operates in secure speech. Additionally,
when CIPHER is selected the first time, you get a series of
beeps as the secure system initializes itself. Key and release
the mic switch to clear the beeps. Either OPR (PB #1) or RV
(PB #10) must be starred (*) in order to select CIPHER.

PB #1 OPR - Operate (OPR) is the other normal operating mode

(along with RV) and is selected by pressing PB #1. OPR will
star when selected. Select OPR, if desired.

D - 27 AVI-6


Text from AVI-6_Have_Quick_and_KY-58_page_34.jpeg:
Operation is as follows:

@ KY-58 operations are very different from normal radio operations.
When you select CIPHER the first time, you get the series of beeps
described above. Clear the crypto alarm beeps with the mic button.
On subsequent transmissions, you will hear a single beep
(approximately one second after keying the mic). Wait until you hear
this beep before speaking.

@ Next, when speaking, SPEAK SLOWLY AND CONCISELY. Avoid
long statements - try to keep your transmissions to 2-4 words at a
time.

@ Ifno beep or side/carrier wave is heard, i.e., the radio is silent, when
attempting CIPHER transmissions, the KY-58 is inoperative; notify
maintenance. Ifa steady tone is heard along with a side/carrier wave
when CIPHER transmissions are attempted, the KY-58 has a problem
with its crypto and secure operations are not possible.

AVI-6 D - 28


Text from AVI-6_Have_Quick_and_KY-58_page_35.jpeg:
@ With CIPHER selected, plain text transmissions will be heard through
KY-58 as long as the receiver is not processing an incoming cipher
transmission and the CIPHER TEXT switch (Figure D-9) is in NORM.
However, the transmitter will still only send a cipher text message.

The following expanded HAVE QUICK information is not
required for FTU operations and will not be included in the
phase test.

HAVE QUICK PROGRAMMING

The first section of this workbook presented an overview of the HQ
capabilities and the elements involved in general AJ operations. It
concluded with a very narrow look at the steps necessary to go “active” on
a generic training mission.

What follows is information that is at times hard to put your finger on, but
is normally not required except in special circumstances, i.e.,
malfunctions, exercise deployments or combat. Read through it for
understanding, and practice it in the CBT lesson. These are the
procedures to manually enter all the frequencies and codes we take for
granted in daily training.

Basic HQ WOD Loading

The WOD elements are normally entered into preset channels 15-20 using
the Air Force mission support system (AFMSS) and mission cartridge/data
transfer module (MC/DTM). Additionally, the following procedures can be
used to manually enter the basic HQ WOD elements using the UHF
submenu in the aircraft.

@ While in channel mode, select channel 20 with the channel selector
knob (a single beep is heard).

@ Select the appropriate UHF submenu.
@ For this example, use the following as the WOD elements:

Ch 20 300.050
Ch 19 225.150
Ch 18 236.050
Ch 17 229.100
Ch 16 323.450

HQ IT Command Codes

As there are no conventional radio switches to work with, four command
code “frequencies” have been designated to act as switches when entered
into channel 20. For HQ II operation, channel 20 can be considered to be
a radio switch. The four command code frequencies (described below) can
be considered to be four different switch positions.

When preset channel 20 is changed to a command code frequency, the
radio is switched to the corresponding HQ II function to make it possible
to enter WOD elements in multiple WODs (MWOD), erase a WOD, load
the frequency managed training frequencies or return the radio to normal
operation.

The command code frequencies were chosen based on two requirements.
First, each frequency had to be an invalid UHF frequency, i.e., below
225.000, and second, it had to be equal to or greater than 220.000 because
of design limitations of the radio. The command code frequencies and
related functions are as follows:

Command Code Frequeney
220.000 Operate/Verify

220.025 WOD Load
220.050 WOD Erase
220.075 FMT-Net Load

Table D - 6.

These are the only four “frequencies” that act as switch positions. Notice
that they are identical except for the last two digits. It is not necessary to
memorize these numbers as they are included in HQ II checklists.

Briefly, the Operate/Verify command switches both radios to the normal
operate mode. The MWOD Load command prepares both radios to accept
MWODs, MWOD elements and date assignments. The MWOD Erase
command is used to erase an MWOD. The FMT-Net Frequency Load
command is used to load the FMT-net training frequencies to the
expanded memory board.

D- 35 AVI-6


Text from AVI-6_Have_Quick_and_KY-58_page_42.jpeg:
When the command code frequency for MWOD Load, MWOD Erase or
FMT-Net Frequency Load is entered into channel 20, the normal
transmit/receive functions of both radios are disabled in preparation for
programming functions.

HQ II MWOD Loading

To initiate the MWOD loading procedure for UHF 2, select either UHF
submenu and do the following:

@ Type 20 into the scratchpad and enter at PB #1. Type the MWOD

Load command code frequency 220.025 into the scratchpad and enter

listen for a single beep.

Repeat these procedures for channels 18-15. A single beep should be

heard each time the tone is toggled to UHF 2. An entire WOD is now
stored in nonvolatile radio memory.

AVI-6 D - 38


Text from AVI-6_Have_Quick_and_KY-58_page_45.jpeg:
Next, a day of the month date must be assigned to the WOD through
channel 14.

WOD Date

The date code frequency is 3XX.000; the XX digits of the frequency
represent the day of the month. For example, if it is the 18th day of the
month, the frequency is 318.000. Use the following procedure to load the
WOD date:

@ Type 14 into the scratchpad and enter at PB #1. Type the applicable
day of the month frequency into the scratchpad and enter at PB #10.
In our example, the WOD stored is for the 18th day of the month;
therefore, the frequency is 318.000. Next, toggle the tone switch to
UHF 2. A double beep should be heard.

At this point, one complete WOD and its corresponding date are stored in
nonvolatile memory in the radio. As a reminder, this process has not
changed preset channels 14-19. Additional WODs can be stored by
repeating these procedures. The system retains the six most recently
loaded WODs.

If a WOD is loaded with the same date as one already in memory, the new
entry replaces the prior entry. There is no way to access or call up a
previously loaded WOD. Therefore, if a single WOD element must be
changed, the entire WOD for that date must be reloaded.

If you intend to use anti-jam (AJ) immediately, continue with WOD
selection. If not, enter the Operate/Verify command code in channel 20.

With an MWOD loaded, HQ II radios need to be told which day’s WOD to
use. This is currently being done by entering the date in channel 1. Plans
call for fielding a tone generator that will transmit a TOD with not only
the correct time but also the day of the year and the year. Upon receipt of
this improved Mickey, a HQ II radio will set its clock to the correct time
and day of the month and transfer the correct WOD into its processor.
With this done, the radio is ready for net selection. You would not have to
enter a date in channel 1 as the TOD selects the correct WOD.

D - 39 AVI-6


Text from AVI-6_Have_Quick_and_KY-58_page_46.jpeg:
WOD Selection

Once the WOD/WODs have been stored, the current day's date must be
loaded through channel 1 to set the radio's clock so it can select the correct
WOD for use. With the radio still in the MWOD Load function, the
procedure to enter the present day of the month is as follows:

@ Type 1 into the scratchpad and enter at PB #1. Type the frequency for
the applicable day of the month and enter at PB #10. In our example,
it is the 18th day of the month so the frequency is 318.000.

@ Next toggle the tone switch to UHF 2 and listen for a single beep. You
have now selected the WOD.

NOTE

If the radio is switched off, the current day's date is not retained in radio
memory. Therefore, to regain use of the current day's WOD after the radio is

turned back on, you would first change channel 20 to the MWOD Load
command code frequency (220.025). The frequency for the day of the month
would then be reloaded through channel 1.

After you have stored the MWOD and selected a WOD for use, you must
enter the Operate/Verify command code (220.000) in channel 20 to return
the radio to normal operation. You are now ready to receive a TOD and
commence AJ operations.

NOTE

Soon the tone generators that transmit the TOD will be modified so that they
transmit both the correct time and date (day-of-year and year). When you

receive a TOD from a modified tone generator, you will not have to enter the
date through channel 1 as the TOD will include the needed date information.

AVI-6 D - 40


Text from AVI-6_Have_Quick_and_KY-58_page_47.jpeg:
A HQ II radio can append date information to its own Mickey. For
example, a flight leader can enter the WOD date through channel 1 as
previously discussed. The leader can then self-start the radio, or, if an
AN/TRC-187 TOD generator is available, the leader can update the
Mickey (for time) using normal procedures. The correct time and date are
now added to any TOD lead passes to the flight.

MWOD Erase

This function enables you to completely erase the nonvolatile memory
containing the MWOD. To erase the entire MWOD:

@ Change preset channel 20 to command code 220.050.

NOTE

The memory has not been erased yet. You can still recover. If it was not
your intent to erase the MWOD, change channel 20 to the Operate/Verify

command code 220.000. If you still want to erase it, proceed to the next
step.

@ Push the C/M button to select manual (if in channel).

@ Toggle the tone switch to the UHF that contains the MWOD. The tone
switch initiates the erasure operation.

@ Change channel 20 to the Operate/Verify command code 220.000, in
order to switch both radios back to the normal operate mode.

NOTE

It is not necessary to type decimal points and trailing zeros when entering
command codes and WOD elements.

FMT-Net Frequency Load

This HAVE QUICK II function is normally performed by maintenance on
a one time basis as the frequencies are stored in nonvolatile memory and
do not change. The following procedure is used to load the FMT-net
frequencies into UHF 2:

Select the UHF 2 submenu and check that the radio is on.

Select channel and turn the channel selector knob to channel 20. A
single beep sounds.

Enter 20 at PB #1 and enter the FMT-net Load command code
(220.075) at PB #10.

Select manual, type the first net frequency, 235.050, into the
scratchpad and enter at PB #6.

Toggle the tone switch to UHF 2 (a high pitched tone sounds).

Select channel 19 with the channel selector knob, type the second net
frequency, 225.150, into the scratchpad and enter at PB #6.

Toggle the tone switch to UHF 2 and listen for a high pitched tone.

Following the above procedures:

Load 252.925 into channel 18.
Load 239.950 into channel 17.
Load 271.950 into channel 16.
Load 267.850 into channel 15.

Select channel and rotate the channel selector knob to channel 20.
Change it to command code frequency 220.000 to switch both radios back
to the normal operate mode.

Operate/Verify

The Operate/Verify command code switches the radio to the normal
operate mode. To enter the Operate portion of this command code,
channel 20 is changed to command code frequency 220.000 as follows:

@ Type 20 into the scratchpad and enter at PB #1. Type 220.000 into the
scratchpad and enter at PB #10.

The Verify portion of the command code is used to verify the presence of a
particular day's WOD. To verify the presence of a WOD in UHF 2, select
the UHF 2 submenu and accomplish the following:

@ Rotate the channel selector knob to channel 20.

@ Type the desired day of the month frequency in the scratchpad and
enter it at PB #6. For example, for the 15th day, the frequency would
be 315.000. Do not toggle the tone switch.

@ Select manual with the C/M button.

@ Rotate the channel selector knob to channel 19 and back to channel 20;
listen for a single beep. If there is no beep, a WOD for that date is not
present.

NOTE

The radio powers up in the same mode it was in when powered down. If the

radio does not function as expected at power up, enter the Operate/Verify
command code in channel 20.

STUDENT PREPARATION REQUIREMENTS
BEFORE CLASS

1. Study the information contained in this workbook and complete the
questions.

2. Read the HAVE QUICK and KY-58 sections of TO 1F-15E-1.

C-1 AVI-6


Text from AVI-6_Have_Quick_and_KY-58_page_50.jpeg:
The following summarizes the F-15E HAVE QUICK II arrangement:

Channel 20 is used for two purposes. It accepts the command code
frequencies that act as switches to initiate HAVE QUICK II functions.
It also is used to enter and load the first element of the WOD.

Channels 19-15 are used to enter and load the second through the
sixth elements of the WOD.

Channel 14 is used to enter and load the WOD date frequency that
labels each WOD of the MWOD with a specific date.

Channel 1 is used to enter and load the current day of the month
frequency that enables the radio to select the correct WOD.

Preset channels 1-19 are not affected by these functions and remain
available for use as originally preset.

Anytime channel 20 is changed to the command code frequency for
MWOD Load, MWOD Erase, or FMT-Net Frequency Load, both UHF 1
and 2 are switched out of the normal operate mode making it
impossible to transmit or receive on either radio. To regain use of the
radios, the operate portion of the Operate/Verify command code must
be reentered.

When loaded, the FMT-net frequencies are stored in nonvolatile radio
memory. The FMT-nets can be used in conjunction with a basic WOD
or a HQ II WOD.

HAVE QUICK RADIO

In the late ‘70s, our susceptibility to communications jamming was
recognized as the Achilles’ heel of the Tactical Air Forces’ (TAF) command,
control and communication (C*) operations. A workable solution to this
problem was needed quickly. HAVE QUICK (HQ) provided the answer,
furnishing a jam resistant radio that used “off-the-shelf” parts and the
current radio used in most fighter aircraft. HQ is now utilized by TAF
aircrews throughout the world; the list of users includes most fighter
aircraft, AWACS, GCI, forward air controllers and many units from other
commands. This workbook addresses the unclassified portions of the basic
HQ and HQ II radios. More information is available in your squadron
weapons section and in the Tactical Air Warfare Center (TAWC) HAVE
QUICK handbook (SECRET).

Background

Both basic HQ and HQ II employ a pseudo-random frequency hopping
technique that gives them a jam resistant capability. For the layman’s
level of understanding, the radio randomly hops among a set number of
frequencies. Synchronized hopping is a more accurate term since random
hopping would not allow two people operating on the same set of
frequencies to converse. When synchronized, all radios are on the same
frequency. They simply change frequencies automatically on a regular
basis. HQ is not a method for secure radio transmissions since they are
still broadcast in clear text and not encrypted.

Requirements for HQ Radio Usage

Both basic HQ and HQ II are fully compatible with the ARC-164 radios
currently installed in the F-15E. Basic HQ uses the UHFs storage for
channelized frequencies to store HQ variables. This prevents the use of
these channels for normal radio operation. HQ II adds an expanded
memory board to the radio to free up channel storage and increase the
number of stored variables. HQ II may still use channel storage but does
not require it. Basic HQ users cannot program or use HQ II specific
features. HQ II is backward compatible with basic HQ and provides
additional flexibility. Although you normally will use HQ IJ, you may load
both systems and then use either system on UHF 1, UHF 2 or both radios
simultaneously.

Anyone wishing to participate requires a word-of-day (WOD) containing
initialization and frequency codes, a time-of-day (TOD) synchronization
signal and an HQ “active” net (common set) of frequencies to perform
basic HQ or HQ II operations. Different nets allow flights to deconflict
HQ use in the same manner as discrete UHF frequencies deconflict
normal radio transmissions. The WOD, the TOD and the net determine
the type of operation (basic HQ or HQ II), combat or training mode, the
number of frequencies, the hopping order and rate.

Because basic HQ was a modification of existing hardware, normal UHF
control functions and hardware are modified in HQ to actually perform
HQ programming or operation through the radio control head. This can
be confusing at first because programming information and net selection
take place through the use of codes that appear as frequencies. In fact,
the frequency may be simultaneously a usable manual frequency in
“plain” (normal) UHF operation and a specific coded “net” (set of frequency
codes) in “active” (HQ) operation.

HQ II continues the frequency interface convention to use nonfunctional

invalid frequencies in the RF spectrum as command codes to prepare the
radio for loading, selecting and verifying HQ II information.

Word-of-Day (WOD)

The WOD is a set of coded numbers in the form of six UHF frequencies
called WOD elements that initialize the radio for HQ. Elements of the
WOD determine the frequencies, hop rate and hop pattern used during
HQ operations. Both basic HQ and HQ II use the WOD, which may be
transferred to either or both radios through the DTM.

For either version, the aircrew must physically rotate the channel selector
on the radio backwards from channel 20 through 15 to “load” the WOD.
An audible beep is heard on channels 20-16 followed by a double beep as
channel 15 is selected.

Basic HQ (HQ1)

With basic HQ, 6 coded “frequencies,” WOD elements, are preset in
normal channels 15-20. The WOD element in channel 20 is used to
initialize the radio for HQ operation. The WOD elements in channels
15-19 provide specific operating information. All six elements must be
loaded to the radio to “load the WOD.”

The WOD element stored in channel 20 determines what mode the radio
is put in (training or combat) and the rate at which it hops among the
frequencies of the net. To use the training modes of basic HQ or HQ II,
300.0XX must be set as the WOD element in channel 20. The XX can be
00, 25, 50 or 75, and determines the hop rate of the radio.

In the training mode, basic HQ actually hops among the five frequencies
stored in channels 15-19. These five frequencies limit basic HQ to five
training nets. Combat WOD elements are not the actual frequencies
channelized in presets 15-19. They are groups of numbers that provide
codes for HQ combat employment.

The capability of basic HQ to load only one WOD proves to be a limiting
factor. To decrease the likelihood of interruption or jamming by hostile
forces, WOD elements are normally changed every day in combat. Basic
HQ users airborne at 2400Z have to reprogram the WOD elements in
channels 15-19 by rechannelizing with new data and cycling down from
channel 20 to load the new day’s WOD. This is unnecessary in training as
the elements do not change day-to-day.
