TF Couple Switch

The TF couple switch (Figure D-5), located on the CAS panel, is a
two-position over-center toggle switch. It is used to select auto TF (ATF)
by coupling the terrain following climb/dive commands to the automatic
flight control system (AFCS). Switch positions are:

OFF Automatic terrain following is not activated.

COUPLE Couples the TF system to the autopilot. Basic
autopilot is automatically engaged.

Paddle Switch

Located at the base of each control stick, the paddle switch (Figure D-6) is
a two-position switch, spring-loaded to off. When airborne, depressing and
holding the paddle switch returns the system to unarmed manual TF from
auto or armed manual TF. It also disengages the auto flyup, and
disengages the steer mode in use, if one is coupled.

Upfront Control

TF status is indicated on Menu 1, adjacent to PB #4 (Figure D-7). System
status/mode selection is displayed to the right of “TF.” It reads OFF with
the TF radar switch in OFF. After selecting STBY on the TF RDR switch,
N/R (not ready) is displayed during the 3 minute warm-up period. STBY
is displayed when the TF has completed warm-up. After the warm-up
cycle and the TF radar switch is placed to ON, the selected mode of
operation (NORM, ECCM, WX1, WX2, LPI, VLC) is displayed. When ATF
is selected, “TF” is also displayed to the right of “A/P” on the UFC.

Text from LAN-5_TFR_Controls_and_Displays_page_14.jpeg:
The set clearance (SC) can be selected through the UFC on Menu 1 by
typing the desired altitude into the scratchpad and pressing PB #4. The
mode is replaced by the previously selected SC value, which in turn is
replaced by the new flashing SC value for five seconds. Then, the original
mode/status returns. If the entry is invalid (e.g., 350 feet), the scratchpad
flashes.

The other method of selecting set clearance is via the TF display, and is
discussed in the next section.

TF DISPLAY CONTROLS

The TF display, when selected on the desired MPD/MPCD (Figure D-8),
contains the primary controls to define desired TF operation (Figure D-8).
SC, TF frequency, mode of operation, or ride can be selected as follows.

Set Clearance - The SC may be selected by depressing the pushbutton
adjacent to the desired altitude; e.g., pressing PB #18 selects 400 feet.
The 100 feet SC does not appear as an option until VLC has been selected.
(As discussed in the previous section, the SC may also be selected via
Menu 1 on the UFC.)

Frequency - Eight different TF radar frequencies can be selected. F1 is
shown in this example. Press PB #8 to increase the frequency and PB #4
to decrease it. (Rollover does not occur - to move from frequency 8 to
frequency 1, use PB #4.)

Mode - Six different modes of TF operation are selected by depressing one
of the buttons at the bottom of the display. A box appears around the
selected mode (NORM, ECCM, WX1, WX2, LPI and VLC).

Ride - Hard or soft ride is selected by pressing PB #5. (HARD or SOFT

alternates with each depression.) The positive G limit is the same for both
ride selections, but the negative G limit differs.

TF information can be found on different displays, but the information

shown is very similar. Since the HUD is the center of your scan pattern, it
is discussed first (Figure D-9).

HUD

In manual TF, a steering box appears. To maintain the SC, keep the
velocity vector in the box. When ATF is selected, the box changes to a

solid bar to allow monitoring of the aircraft’s vector versus pitch
commands.

LAN-5 D-10


Text from LAN-5_TFR_Controls_and_Displays_page_17.jpeg:
On the right side of the HUD, the radar altitude (up to 1500 feet) is
displayed on a “thermometer” type altimeter scale. A vertical bar expands
from the bottom of the scale, and the top indicates the aircraft’s radar
altitude. From 0 to 500 feet, each tick mark on the left represents 100
feet. Between 500 and 1500 feet, the scale is reduced with ticks at 750
feet, 1000 feet, 1250 feet, and 1500 feet. The caret displayed on the right
side of the scale denotes the selected set clearance. Radar altitude and
true or ground airspeeds can be displayed on the HUD and EADI only if
selected on UFC Data 1 page.

At the bottom of the HUD, two carets are positioned at the left and right
bank limit, indicating the dynamic bank angle allowed by the TF
lead-into-turn command logic.

EADI

For TF operations, the EADI uses the pitch steering bar for both manual
and auto TF (Figure D-10). When flying armed manual or unarmed
manual TF, the point of the waterline symbol (W) should be maintained
on the pitch steering bar just as you would on an ILS approach. It also
displays the “thermometer” altimeter scale on the right side.

TF Display

The TF display, along with the FLIR, allows you to verify proper TF
operation and anticipate pull-up commands (Figure D-11). The “E-scope”
allows you to monitor what terrain the TF radar “sees.”

Pitch command and attitude are displayed on the top left of the scope. A
bank steering bar, an artificial horizon, and, depending on mode, a
manual TF steering box or an auto TF pitch steering bar are presented. A
circle representing the velocity vector is presented for reference to the
steering bars/box. Digital readouts of radar altitude and ground speed are
displayed below the 300 feet SC.

Minimum en route altitude (MEA) is displayed in the center top portion of
the E-scope display. The information is loaded into the steer point
submenu either manually or via the DTM. The MEA represents the
minimum en route altitude for the leg you are currently flying. As you
pass the steer point it will automatically change to the MEA for the next
leg of your route.

TF Radar Switch

The TF radar switch (Figure D-2), located on the sensor control panel,
controls power to the terrain following radar in the NAV pod. The switch
has three positions:

OFF All power to the TF radar is removed.

STBY Allows the system to accomplish the required 3 minute
warm-up period before actually operating.

ON The TF radar is allowed to transmit when ground
speed is approximately 70 knots, and weight is off the
wheels.

NOTE
When on the ground, with ON selected, the TF FAIL should illuminate
because the system tries to operate, but is unable to transmit.

Flyup Enable Switch

The flyup enable switch (Figure D-3) is a two position toggle switch
located vertically on the cockpit bulkhead, just outboard of the throttles.
It is guarded with a red cover.

WARNING

The red cover guard on the flyup enable
switch can be down with the switch in
either position. Ensure that the switch is
in the proper position.

OFF Switch up. In manual TF, the automatic flyup feature is not
armed. If commanded, the flight controls will not automatically
accomplish a flyup. In the rear cockpit, there is a green
“UNARMED/NO ATF” advisory light indicating the switch is off.
This light is located on the warning/caution/advisory light panel
above the RCP MPD/MPCDs (Figure D-4).

ON Switch down. This is the normal position. In manual TF, the
automatic flyup is armed. If commanded, the flight controls
automatically accomplish the flyup.
