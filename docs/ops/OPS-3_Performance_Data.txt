PERFORMANCE CHARTS EXAMPLE

In this section, performance data is computed for four specific phases of
flight—Takeoff and Landing, Climb, Cruise, and Emergency Divert. The
sample problem presented will use the transition configuration, typical of
your first few transition sorties.

For this problem the following data applies:

Runway 26

Wind 280/30G40
Temperature 68° F
Takeoff Gross Weight 60,000 lbs
Landing Gross Weight 45,000 lbs

“Rules of Thumb” used in training will be presented where applicable.

Gotchas

There are several places in performance charts where important
information is often overlooked. Most performance charts have a
configuration entry. The configuration sometimes states “individual drag
indexes,” “flaps and gear retracted, all drag indexes,” or “without CFTs.”

There are other items to check also. Look for notes which contain
definitive information (e.g., preclimb figures for time, distance, and fuel).
The chart title can also include such things as gear and flap configuration,
gross weight, power settings, and engine type. Some charts look alike, so
it is imperative that you read the small print on these charts. If you are
careless, it is easy to get into the wrong chart and get some very
misleading data.

Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD)

Wind Components

Before computing TOLD, the wind components and density ratio must be
computed. The Wind Components Chart is on the back cover of your
checklist.

This chart is used to break down the wind into head/tail and crosswind
components. You must add half of the gust velocity to the steady state
velocity.

Given:
Wind 280/30G40
Runway 26

Find: (Figure D-1)
Headwind and crosswind components.
Enter with the relative bearing of the wind and wind speed on the arcs.

For example, 280° wind - 260° runway = 20° off RWY HDG. Given 30G40
and G = 10, add 5 kts to get 35 kts effective wind speed.

Maximum Abort Speed

The maximum abort charts provide the maximum speed at which an abort
decision can be made, the abort initiated, and the aircraft stopped within
the remaining runway length. Time allowances are 3 seconds with both
engines operating at the initial thrust setting, 2 seconds to apply wheel
brakes, and 5 seconds to reach idle thrust.

The checklist only has charts for density ratios of 0.8 and 1.0, so use the
closest one.

Given:

Aircraft with CFTs, maximum thrust takeoff, -220 engines

Gross Weight 60,000 lbs
Density Ratio 0.98

Text from OPS-3_Performance_Data_page_16.jpeg:
Notes:

OPS-3

1:

This speed must be adjusted for headwind/tailwind (33
knots) so the abort speed in this example is 179 knots.

The maximum abort speed chart does not take into account
barrier engagement, but only aircraft stopping performance
for the given field conditions. Any abort above this speed
must have a successful cable engagement to stop on the
runway.

Lower weight aircraft are often shown to have lower
maximum abort speeds than higher weight aircraft. This is
because they accelerate to a faster speed during the abort
decision period used in the calculations, thus a lower
decision speed must be used.


Text from OPS-3_Performance_Data_page_17.jpeg:
Minimum Go Speed

The Minimum Go Speed chart was developed to let the aircrew know
when it would be possible to continue the takeoff in a heavyweight single
engine situation. There is no Minimum Go Speed chart in the checklist, so
you must use TO 1F-15E-1-1. This chart was built such that, at the
indicated minimum go speed, you can suffer an engine failure, take 3
seconds to make a decision, and still make it off the ground. In the case of
a military thrust takeoff, another 3 seconds is allowed to push the good
throttle to max AB. Use a 10° pitch attitude for all single engine takeoffs.

Given:

Aircraft with CFTs, maximum thrust takeoff, -220 engines

Density Ratio 0.98

Available Runway Length 11,000 feet (dry)
Takeoff Gross Weight 60,000 lbs
Takeoff Gross Weight (Combat) 80,000 lbs

Find: (Figure D-4)
Minimum go speed for both gross weights.

Enter with density ratio on the left side. Project across to the available

runway length. Parallel the nearest guideline to intersect the baseline.

From that intersection, move to intersect the gross weight line and then
read left to determine minimum go speed. The dotted lines are used for
air-to-ground weapons or fuel tanks on the wing stations.

Figure D - 4.

The minimum go speed for combat (Figure D-4) is 166 KCAS. For practice
load gross weights less than 75,000 lbs, the minimum go speed is not

available at standard temperatures and lower altitudes. The high

minimum go speed at heavy weight makes the decision to abort more
critical.

OPS-3


Text from OPS-3_Performance_Data_page_19.jpeg:
Note: The minimum go speed for a maximum thrust takeoff is less
than that for a military thrust takeoff due to the greater
acceleration achieved by being in afterburner from the start of
takeoff up to and including the 3 second decision time. There is
more runway still available for acceleration on the one engine.

WARNING

If an engine is lost above the maximum
abort speed but below the minimum go
speed, the pilot can neither abort nor take
off safely on the runway length remaining
without considering such factors as
reducing gross weight or engaging the
arrestment cable.

Referring back to the maximum abort speed chart (Figure D-3) the
maximum abort speed is about 141 knots for an 80,000 pound aircraft
which means that between 141 and 166 knots you would need a cable to
stop.

Rule of Thumb:

At Seymour Johnson, with an available runway length greater than
11,000 feet, a density ratio above .9, and a gross weight of less than
65,000 lbs, the minimum go speed will not usually be a factor.

Figure D - 5.

The takeoff distance on the chart is 2100 feet. However, the chart is
based on a maximum performance takeoff using 12° of pitch and no wind
(Figure D-5, Note 3). For our normal 10° takeoff, you must add 10% to the
takeoff distance.

The maximum takeoff distance would then be 2310 feet (2100 x 110%).
With a headwind component of 33 knots the takeoff roll will obviously be

less.

Text from OPS-3_Performance_Data_page_22.jpeg:
Notes: 1. Since the charts offer limited choices, you must interpolate
for varying temperatures, altitudes, and gross weights.

2. Ifa significant tail wind exits (more than 10 knots), you
must use the charts in TO 1F-15E-1-1.

Rotation Speed/Nosewheel Liftoff Speed/Takeoff Speed
The point at which the nose comes off the ground, and when the aircraft
starts flying, depends on gross weight, position of the center of gravity
(CG), and the amount of thrust. Thrust affects both the pitching moment
and the ability to hold the nose up. This is a relatively simple chart in the
checklist and it also gives a brief description of normal takeoff procedures.

Landing Speed and Distance

During planning, you should compute landing data for an emergency
heavyweight landing as well as a normal end of mission landing.

The charts offer two landing roll-out techniques:

1. Aerodynamic Braking

2. Maximum Antiskid Braking
As you will see in the following examples and due to the minimal
deceleration above 100 knots with antiskid, aerodynamic braking is the
recommended technique, especially when heavyweight or landing on a wet

runway.

Notes: 1. All landing distances are based on speed brake extension at
touchdown.

2. Ifa significant tailwind exists (more than 10 knots), you
must use the charts in TO 1F-15E-1-1.

The following four landing distance charts compute landing distance
under the given conditions.

The approach speed is still 184 knots.
The landing distance is 7250 feet dry/12,550 feet wet.

Note: There is a 300 foot difference dry and a 3850 foot difference wet

which exceeds the available runway. For a wet runway, you must plan for
a departure-end cable, reduce weight, or use aerobraking.

D-27 OPS-3


Text from OPS-3_Performance_Data_page_34.jpeg:
Rule of Thumb:

To compute a backup approach speed for 21 units AOA, use 155 Knots
+ (2 X fuel remaining in thousands of pounds)

Example: 10,000 lbs of fuel remaining
155 + 20 = 175 knot approach speed
If making a no flap approach add 15 knots
155 + 15 + 20 = 190 knot approach speed
Remember to add the extra weight of unexpected stores to fuel weight if

applicable. CFTs, Pylons/Pods and SUUs are included in the 155 knot
baseline.

Landing Distance Rules of Thumb:

Lower nose by 100 knots to keep control of nose drop. Do not raise flaps in
aerobrake unless runway is icy. Lower nose NLT 2 runway remaining.

Keep CAS < 2 X runway remaining marker X 10.

If runway length is greater than fuel remaining, landing distance on a dry
runway is within limits.

Maximum Cable Engagement Speeds

Due to the light structure of the F-15E hook system, there are limits on
cable engagement ground speeds. When planning an approach-end cable
engagement or the possibility of a departure-end cable engagement exists
(wet runway), compute the maximum cable engagement ground speed
from the chart in the emergency section of the checklist (Figure D-12).
When flying an approach for an approach-end cable engagement, it is good
technique to have ground speed displayed on the HUD and to consider the
effect of surface winds on calibrated airspeed in anticipation of cable
engagement ground speed.

OPS-3


Text from OPS-3_Performance_Data_page_36.jpeg:
Rule of Thumb:

Heavy weight landings begin with full weights in excess of 10,000 lbs. For
a transition configured aircraft, plan to dump fuel to 7000 lbs or less for
an approach-end cable engagement. This will allow an engagement below
160 knots ground speed.

Climb/Cruise Charts

These checklist charts are dual-purpose, with a climb section at the top,
and four different optimum cruise sections below based on the fuel
remaining. Each chart is based on a specific drag index and engine type.
Recommended climb schedules are also included on the charts.

For training, use the DI = 40 chart for transition and air-to-air missions,
and the DI = 60 chart for surface attack missions. For combat
heavyweight loads, compute the DI and use the chart with a DI equal or
higher, if available, or you must use the charts in

TO 1F-15E-1-1.

Climb Section

This section of the chart is used to determine time, distance, and fuel
remaining to reach the desired altitude. Preclimb data and assumptions
are included at the bottom of the chart.

Notes: 1. Climb charts are based on a sea level takeoff. Takeoffs
from a higher altitude will result in actual time/
distance/fuel numbers slightly lower than those computed.

2. The checklist charts all assume military power climbs. For
maximum power climbs use the climb charts in
TO 1F-15E-1-1.

3. Fuel for start, taxi, run-up and takeoff to the start climb
point are included in the checklist charts. However, the
assumptions made may be unrealistic. For precise data,
refer to the climb charts in TO 1F-15E-1-1.

OPS-3 D - 30


Text from OPS-3_Performance_Data_page_37.jpeg:
4. These charts are still based on JP-4 fuel. The starting fuel
will be about 1000 lbs greater with JP-8. Using the chart
numbers will be conservative.

5. Time to climb is in decimal format; 1.45 minutes is 1
minute and 27 seconds.

Text from OPS-3_Performance_Data_page_41.jpeg:
Rule of Thumb:

With a drag index below 40, 100 pounds/minute is a conservative fuel
consumption at optimum altitude and airspeed.

Emergency Divert

To plan a maximum range divert in a fuel critical situation, refer to the
“Fuel Used to Divert, PW-220 Engine” chart in the emergency section of
the checklist. This chart provides fuel data for two “no-wind” divert
options:

1. Climb from sea level to optimum divert altitude, cruise and
descent back to sea level.

2. Cruise at sea level throughout the divert.

In all cases, the climb/cruise/descent profile uses less total fuel but over
diverts of less than 50 nm, the difference is negligible.

Note 6 at the bottom of the chart is critical. You must add landing fuel to
determine if you should attempt the divert. The minimum planned fuel at
the divert field is 2000 pounds for Seymour Johnson aircraft.

Note: For a given amount of fuel (1000 lbs) in JP-8, there will be a
smaller volume than if JP-4. However, thrust is based partly on
mass of fuel. Therefore if 1000 lbs is required by the chart and
you have 1000 lbs of JP-8 you will be able to go about the same
distance.

OPS-03-15

Figure D - 15.

The total fuel used to divert at 33,000 feet is 1700 pounds. The climb
speed (note 4) would be 350 KCAS/.88 M. Cruise at .80 Mach and descend
at 220 KCAS (note 5) when 57 nm from destination.

Notes: 1. 57% of your 100 nm divert is in a descent. It also took
about 25 nm to climb. Therefore, short diverts will include
very little cruise at optimum altitude.

2. Diversion at sea level will use about 700 lbs more. For a
diversion of 50 nm, you only save 200 lbs by climbing to
18,000 feet.

3. Do not forget to add landing fuel.

4. The divert chart is located in the last few pages of the EP
portion of the checklist.

Cruise Data Display

Cruise data is on the engine monitor display (EMD) (Figure D-16) to
provide the aircrew a recommended flight profile based on optimizing for
max range and comparing this range to the straightline ground range to
his base or other specified navigation point. These calculations are
computed using data for the P229 engines rather than P220 engines. This
will give you a slightly pessimistic fuel figure.

The aircrew enters the sequence point desired as the terminus by
scratchpad transfer from the UFC to PB #10. The system defaults to
BASE at power-up as the return point at power-up with weight on wheels.
The current straightline range to the selected point appears above the
entry.

D - 37 OPS-3


Text from OPS-3_Performance_Data_page_44.jpeg:
The aircrew enters the desired ending (reserve) fuel by scratchpad
transfer to PB #8. The system defaults to 1200 pounds at power-up with
weight on wheels, and this is also the minimum allowable value. Values
less than 1200 pounds or more than the current fuel quantity will not be
accepted. At Seymour Johnson minimum fuel is 1900 pounds.

The max cruise profile is based on the aircraft performing a standard,
constant airspeed climb to the recommended altitude, cruising at that
altitude at the recommended airspeed, and making a standard descent to
the destination. Drag indices are implied from aircraft weight.

For weights under 55,000 pounds, the climb is a constant airspeed climb
at 350 KCAS to 0.90 M to the recommended altitude.

For weights over 55,000 pounds it is a 300 KCAS to 0.75 M climb.
The descent is based on idle power, 220 KCAS, speed brake retracted.

Optimum cruise altitude and airspeed are presented on the cruise data
display on the MPD engine display as “Command Altitude” and
“Command Mach.”

The system then subtracts the fuel used to ascend from the current
altitude to the cruise altitude, the fuel consumed during the descent from
cruise altitude to the destination, and the end (reserve) fuel from the fuel
available. The resultant fuel available for cruise is divided by the fuel
consumption rate to determine the max time at optimum cruise altitude.
Cruise time is converted to cruise range using nominal true airspeed and
current winds to calculate ground speed.

Time to climb, time to cruise, and time to descend are summed to give
total time in max cruise profile, which is displayed to the aircrew.

Distance covered during climb, distance covered during cruise, and

distance covered during descent are summed to give total range in max
cruise profile, which is displayed to the aircrew.

Divert Rules of Thumb:

While determining precise divert data, you can save fuel by using the
following ROTs as soon as you determine a divert is needed.

1.

2.

7.

Put your divert base on the nose.

Climb in mil power at 350 K/.88 Mach (DI < 40)

. Climb to 1/8 the divert distance (maximum of 47,000 ft)

Example: Divert Distance = 90 nm
Climb to 30,000 ft

(Do not use more than ‘% of your fuel in the climb).

. Cruise at Max Range AOA:

14 units if below 25,000 ft
14.5 units if above 25,000 ft

. Begin your descent at twice your altitude in miles from

destination.

Example: Cruise Altitude = 30,000 ft
Begin descent 60 nm out

Based on “no-wind.” Decrease range for a headwind, increase for a
tailwind.

. Descend at Max Endurance AOA or 220 knots:

17.0 units if above 25,000 ft
18.0 units if below 25,000 ft

Enter data on the cruise data display on the MPD engine display and

compare to the checklist divert charts for precise data as soon as you are
able.

The fuel flow is 109 lbs/minute at sea level and 100 lbs/minute at 10,000

Note: The fuel used to climb exceeds the advantage of slightly lower
fuel flow at altitude. With turbine engines, there is little to be

Stopping Distance Charts

Stopping distance charts were added with change 3 to the F-15E-1CL-1.
There is general agreement that the stopping distance charts are not as
useful as they could be. Data is incomplete and charts for aerobraking on
wet and icy runways are not provided. Another observation is that the
numbers are slightly in conflict with the landing distance charts. For
example, the landing distance charts all show that aerobraking is better
than max antiskid. The stopping distance charts show the opposite. (For
minimum run landings with all kinds of runway conditions, see

TO 1F-15E-1, pages 2-22 and 7-3.) The questions are “what is the
difference between landing and stopping distance?” and “when do crews
need to use both sets of data?” Current guidance and the AFMSS (Air
Force Mission Support System) only require aircrews to calculate landing
distance (normal and heavyweight, wet and dry runway) and landing
distance charts assume landing over a 50-foot obstacle, whereas stopping
distance charts only consider the distance required to stop.

Considering only the stopping distance charts, simple rule of thumb
conclusions would be:

Runway Condition

Dry Max antiskid braking as soon as possible*

Wet or icy Aerobrake until the nose falls through, then
max antiskid braking to a stop.

*According to the stopping distance charts, aerobraking on a dry runway
results in slightly longer stopping distances, but probably saves wear and
tear on the brakes. For maintenance reasons, you might want to
aerobrake anyway, but if you decide to use max antiskid you should
consider use of speed brake as another form of aerobraking.

Wind Shear and Microburst Activity

Wind shear is beyond the scope of this course and will sometimes be
addressed as a special topic in instrument refresher training. There is no
clear guidance in TO 1F-15E-1, but a good technique would be to compute
a reference ground speed (approach speed corrected for known winds),
have ground speed displayed on the HUD, and Data 1 displayed on the
UFC. Ifthe aircrew is in the habit of including displayed ground speed as
compared to reference ground speed in their cross-check, the need for an
immediate go-around due to unsuspected wind shear and microburst
activity would be more readily apparent. As was mentioned earlier in the
discussion on approach-end cable engagements, knowing your planned
versus actual ground speed on final and having the WSO cross-check the
UFC for winds can help for wind shear detection, cable engagements, and
landing distances.

Combat Planning

For combat missions, there are other factors that must be considered. As
mentioned earlier, with heavier gross weights, minimum go speeds
become important. In addition, the mission length may cause fuel
computations to be critical. You will need to run computations for each
phase of flight. You need to figure fuel used in a heavyweight climb and
cruise to the descent point; time, fuel and distance to descend; and the
higher fuel rates for low level ingress. You then need to refigure the
return portion of flight using the same charts, in reverse order at the
lighter weights following ordnance delivery.

There are a few charts in the checklist for high drag indices and fuel

configurations, but most of the time you will need to use a computer
program or go to TO 1F-15E-1-1.

GENERAL INFORMATION

This workbook is intended to be used with your Dash 1 checklist,
Performance Data with F100-PW-220 engines, using JP-8 fuel weights, to
familiarize you with the information available for the F-15E. However,
some data is only found in TO 1F-15E-1-1.

Although F-15E mission data may be computed using AFMSS or other
software mission planning programs (to be taught in other lessons), the
aircrew must be able to compute all required information using the
checklist and other charts when a computer is not available.

Aircrews are required to compute and have the following takeoff and
landing data (TOLD) on their mission data (lineup) cards: acceleration
check speed (N/A for F-15E until appropriate performance data is
incorporated in the Dash 1), refusal/maximum abort speed (dry/wet),
takeoff speed and distance, normal/heavyweight landing distance
(dry/wet), and single engine takeoff speed (SETOS). At present, this is an
Air Combat Command (ACC) requirement only.

Weight And Drag Index

Several charts require drag index (DI) and gross weight (GW) values.
Specific drag indexes and gross weight data for external stores are found
in the Station Loading charts, Part 1 of Appendix A of

TO 1F-15E-1-1.

The drag index for a specific configuration is found by multiplying the
number of stores carried by its drag index, and adding the drag index of
the suspension equipment. Always use a checklist chart of a higher drag
index than you have computed (i.e., round “up” to be conservative). Gross
weight computations are made the same as drag computations with JP-8
fuel weights.
