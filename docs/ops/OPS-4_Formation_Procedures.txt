AIR COMBAT COMMAND


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_10.jpeg:
The automatic pitch trim feature and the relative stability of the F-15E
significantly reduce the problem of maintaining proper position. Proper
position can be maintained with relatively small throttle and control stick
adjustments.

The large wingspan, combined with a wing well aft of the cockpit, requires
the fingertip formation position to be flown well forward of the leader’s
wing line. The above references are established to provide wingtip
clearance and enable you to maintain a stable position. Since the fan lags
the core engine response, every throttle movement is followed by an
additional delayed thrust change. Anticipate this delayed thrust response
when making changes. Additionally, due to the nature of stick force
sensor, a “white knuckle” grip on the stick tends to cause jerky flight
control inputs. Use a relaxed grip.

Common Errors

@ Overcontrolling power.

Flying too close.

Overcontrolling roll and/or pitch.

Focusing on one reference, and not using all references to crosscheck
for good position.

Weather Position

Weather formation in the F-15E may require some adjustment in your
formation procedures. There are some considerations that are
particularly noteworthy. The flight control system produces excellent
handling qualities that enhance formation flying. When flying fingertip
formation in turbulent conditions, do not attempt to rapidly counteract
every gust with control inputs. Remember, your leader is flying in the
same patch of air and both your aircraft and his react in a similar manner
to rough air.

When flying formation in the weather, a little more of the lead or
reference aircraft is needed by the wingman. This position produces
significant wingtip overlap; therefore, if you lose sight, immediately
execute the applicable lost wingman procedure.

Echelon
Echelon formation is generally used in the traffic pattern for landing or to
get all wingmen on one side when the leader plans to turn away from the

formation.

Visual References

The relative position on the leader or preceding aircraft is the same as
fingertip. Avoid turns into the echelon, if at all possible. If making a turn
into the echelon, each aircraft maintains the same relative position as for
straight and level flight. On turns away from the echelon, maintain the
fuselages in the same horizontal plane (Figure D-5) to ensure the aircraft
is in fingertip upon roll out. Fore/aft position is maintained by keeping
the preceding aircraft's intake ramp leading edge on the pilot’s helmet.

Common Errors

@ A tendency to get behind initially by not matching lead’s rate of roll, or
pull and/or not adding power, and then adjusting too late and/or
overcontrolling.

@ Climbing at the beginning of the turn.

OPS-4 D-6


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_13.jpeg:
Route

Route (Figure D-6) is an extension of fingertip formation with up to
approximately 500 feet between aircraft. It allows the wingman increased
mission crosscheck time and enhances the ability to clear for the
formation when tactical formation is not practical. Route position is also
used for rejoins.

Visual References

@ Line up the anticollision light under the UHF antenna as in fingertip.

OPS-04-06

Figure D - 6. Route.

@ Fly out to a maximum of 500 feet.

@ When turned into, stack down as necessary to stay out of lead's
maneuvering plane and to keep lead in sight.

@ When turned away from, use echelon references.

Cross-unders

The cross-under is an integral part of close formation. It is the disciplined
and safe way to change formation so that lead and the wingmen know
how, when and what to do.

Procedures

Some of these moves or procedures are done simultaneously. However, in
the learning stages each move should be perfected before combining.

After receiving the prebriefed voice or visual signal for a cross-under,
pull back power slightly.

Drop down slightly to be clear of lead’s jetwash, remembering your
aircraft’s tails are tall.

Establish nose-tail separation, and add power slightly to stop aft
movement.

Use a small bank angle to change heading 2-3° and add power to
cross-under to the same relative position on the other side and readjust
power to stop the overtake/closure. Align your heading with lead's
heading.

Add power slightly to move forward and up, with wingtip clearance,
into close formation, and stabilize.

D-9 OPS-4


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_16.jpeg:
If Number Two is required to cross-under in a flight of three or more,
Number Three must move out wider to make room for Number Two. Once
Number Two moves forward, Three reforms on Two’s wing.

When an element performs a cross-under, the element drops below and aft
for nose-tail clearance. Number Four also crosses Three during the

element cross-under.

Common Errors

@ Excessive power changes.

@ Too fast for conditions or proficiency.

@ Dropping too far aft or too low.

@ Getting tails (rudders) in lead’s jet wash.

@ Dishing out or moving too wide in the new position.

@ Element or Number Three moves too wide as Number Two assumes
new position.

Trail Formation Exercise
The purpose of the trail formation (Figure D-8) as described in this lesson
is to increase the student’s “heads-out” piloting skills in the F-15E and to

improve his/her skill in three-dimensional maneuvering with respect to
another aircraft.

Night Formation
The position is the same as Day Fingertip but the references are different.

Visual References

The fore/aft reference is placing the wingtip formation light one length in
front of the tail formation light.

The vertical reference is placing the wingtip formation light about 1/2 foot
above a line between the nose and the tail formation lights (Figure D-9).
For night weather formation position, slide back to put the wingtip light
halfway between the fuselage lights.

Figure D - 9. Night Lighting.

OPS-4 D-12


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_19.jpeg:
The vertical tail floodlights aid in maintaining formation position. When
in formation, lead has anti-collision lights off and position lights steady.
All others are lit the same except the last aircraft keeps the anti-collision
lights on unless briefed otherwise by lead.

Staring at one light can cause it to appear to move, thereby creating

confusion for the wingman and a dangerous situation. Keep eyes moving,

using all references.

Procedures

@ 3800 feet spacing for taxi on the centerline.

@ No visual signals at night except for no radio (NORDO).

@ Lead changes are called over the radio in wings level flight.

@ No lead changes below 1500 feet AGL unless on GCA downwind.

@ If the flight splits up, lead calls attitude, airspeed, altitude and
altimeter setting, and the wingman must acknowledge and confirm

good navigation aids.

@ Formation landings will only be made at night for safe aircraft
recovery.

@ When in positions other than fingertip, route, or tactical, aircraft
spacing will be maintained primarily by instruments, radar/AAI,
and/or timing with visual reference secondary. If aircraft spacing
cannot be ensured, altitude separation (minimum of 1000 feet) will be
established. At all times, aircrews will crosscheck instruments to
ensure ground clearance.

FORMATION TAKEOFFS AND LANDINGS

Formation Takeoffs

Procedures

Fore/aft reference is head abeam UHF antenna.

Wingman lines up assuring wingtip clearance.

80% power is selected upon runup signal.

Brakes are released on lead’s head nod.

Power is advanced to full AB and adjusted as necessary.

Tap brakes (if necessary) to prevent overrunning lead.

Maintain lateral and fore/aft position and match lead’s rotation.

The flight leader will retract gear and flaps when the wingman is
observed to be safely airborne. If no visual signal is briefed, the
wingman’s cue to retract gear and flaps is when lead's nose gear door
opens.

Transition to fingertip references and assume that position after gear
and flap retraction. The WSO must devote primary attention to
monitoring the engines, warnings and cautions, and gear/flap

retraction since the pilot is devoting primary attention to formation
positioning.

Four-Ship Line-Up

For four-ship line-up (Figure D-10), it is important for Number Two to
line-up with his inside pylon on the runway centerline. This position
allows both Number Three and Four to move into position. Number Three
positions himself to the outside, aligning helmets. Four’s position is in
tight between Number One and Two, pulling forward of the tails far
enough to see both pilot and WSO in Number Three’s jet. This position
keeps Number Four out of the lead element’s jet wash during their
run-up. An alternative is a 2 + 2 lineup with 500 foot element spacing.

Takeoff Restrictions

Formation takeoffs will not be made when:

@ There are more than two ship elements.

@ Aircraft are more than 3000 lbs difference in weight.

e@ Aircraft are not symmetrically loaded.

@ The runway width is less than 125 feet.

@ There is standing water, ice, slush or snow on the runway.
@ The crosswind or gust component exceeds 15 knots.

@ Carrying live air-to-ground munitions.

@ Ferrying from contractor/AFMC.

@ Computed takeoff roll exceeds 70% of available runway.

Formation Takeoff Aborts

Formation abort procedures must be briefed and thoroughly understood
by all flight members. Ifa flight member aborts, the first priority is
aircraft control. A radio call should be made when control is assured to
alert the other flight members. Make every effort to maintain the
appropriate side of the runway.

OPS-4 D-16


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_23.jpeg:
Formation Landings

Wingman Procedures

Configure when signaled and use approximately 1/2 speedbrake as
briefed.

When VMC on final:

@ Stack level with lead. A good reference for stacking level with lead is
to position the aircraft so that the leader’s opposite MPD is visible.
Another vertical reference is lead’s helmet on the true horizon; you
should also be able to see 6-8 inches of the opposite engine hump.

@ Align abeam UHF antenna.
@ Maintain a minimum of 10 feet wingtip clearance.

Fly formation to touchdown, but crosscheck runway approaching flare and
touchdown. Anticipate power reduction and flare.

After touchdown, maintain your side of the runway and aerobrake as soon
as prudent (to approximately 13° of pitch with fully extended speed
brake).

If the wingman overruns the leader, accept the overrun and maintain the
appropriate side of the runway and aircraft control. Do not attempt
reposition behind the leader. The most important consideration is wingtip
clearance.

D-17 OPS-4


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_24.jpeg:
Landing Restrictions

Formation landings will not be made when:

There are more than two ship elements.

There is not a straight-in approach (precision preferred).
Combined fuel/stores weight is greater than 10,000 pounds.

There is more than 3000 lbs difference in weight.

Aircraft are not symmetrically loaded.

The runway width is less than 125 feet.

The runway is wet or icy, or there is slush or snow on the runway.
The crosswind or gust component exceeds 10 knots.

The wingman is not upwind with a crosswind greater than 5 knots.

Landing with hung ordnance or unexpended live ordnance, excluding
live air-to-air munitions.

The weather is less than 500 feet and 1.5 nm, or your weather
category, whichever is greater.

Common Errors

Flying too low or too far back.

Not maintaining proper wingtip spacing.

Making corrections too large or too fast, thus overcontrolling.

Not compensating for different handling characteristics at slow speed.

Not aerobraking or maintaining your side of the runway.

OPS-4 D-18


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_25.jpeg:
JOIN-UPS
General

Any join-up requires an accurate appraisal of position and closure. The
low drag nature of the airframe and relative effectiveness of the speed
brake requires some anticipation for throttle reduction. If desired, obtain
an auto acquisition lock-on and select GUN or SRM mode during the
rejoin to provide additional range and overtake information. (Note:
Reference TO 1F-15E-34-1-1 for information on the HUD gun display.
Remember that Vc includes angular closure, so watch your airspeed, too).

@ NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF LEAD.
@ Join in sequence.

@ Adhere to the weather restrictions of 1500/3 for day join-ups and
3000/5 for night join-ups.

Turning Join-Ups

Lead Procedures

@ Maintain airspeed of 350 KCAS, unless otherwise briefed/called.
@ Maintain a bank angle of 30° or less.

Wingman Procedures

Join on the inside of the turn. Number Two remains on the inside, and
Numbers Three and Four slide to the outside. Four crosses behind Three
as the element crosses behind the lead element. A radar lock-on will
provide range and overtake information.

Techniques to control overtake include:

@ Maintain approximately 400 KCAS = about 50-100 knots of actual
overtake (Vc).

@ Use bank angle control for fore/aft position.
@ Airspeed advantage and cut-off together provide the closure rate.

@ For vertical separation, keep lead slightly above the horizon.

D-19 OPS-4


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_26.jpeg:
Use bank angle to get inside lead’s turn.

Align with an extension of normal fingertip fore/aft position.
Superimpose lead's far tail over outside wingtip.

Maintain position with bank angle and G as necessary.

Strive to keep fuselage aligned with lead’s.

Maintaining airspeed advantage, cut off, and fuselage aligned with lead
provides smooth decrease of lateral separation. At approximately 3000
feet, start power reduction to control overtake. The overtake at 1500 feet
should be about 50 knots—do not stagnate here.

Stabilize in route, and then slide to fingertip. When the overtake is
excessive, initiate a controlled overshoot.

Reduce bank angle, keep lead (flight) in sight, ensure nose-tail
separation and pass behind and below lead. Slide to the outside of the
turn. Do not slide forward of lead.

Stabilize, smoothly cross back under, move back to route and then slide
to fingertip.

Both crew members should monitor the rejoin to prevent late
recognition of an overshoot situation.

Common Errors

Dropping too low.

Not establishing quick, proper cut-off.
Matching airspeed too soon and stagnating.
Fixation with radar and HUD.

Not recognizing, or properly accomplishing, an overshoot.

OPS-4 D - 20


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_27.jpeg:
Straight Ahead Join-Up
Lateral separation and overtake are very difficult to judge, and the F-15E
provides a fairly small visual profile from the rear. This requires planning

and attention when performing the straight ahead rejoin.

Lead Procedures

Maintain 350 KCAS unless otherwise briefed/called.

Wingman Procedures

@ Aim for a lateral position 200-500 feet from lead.

@ Closure of 100-125 knots at 6000 feet is controllable.

@ Reduce overtake to reach 3000 feet with 50 knots closure.

@ Stabilize in route and smoothly move to fingertip.

@ Use the velocity vector as an aid by placing it just to the side of lead.

The technique of obtaining a radar lock-on is even more important here to
judge overtake.

If a controlled overshoot is required:
@ Maintain a position slightly below lead and turn slightly away.

@ Keep lead in sight, stabilize, and move back to route and then proceed
to the fingertip position.

@ Don’t cross control to lose speed (throttles and speedbrakes should be
sufficient)

Number Two normally joins on the left wing and the element joins on the
right wing unless otherwise briefed.

D-21 OPS-4


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_28.jpeg:
Common Errors

@ Too much overtake.

@ Matching airspeed too soon and stagnating.

@ Not recognizing or properly executing an overshoot.
VISUAL SIGNALS

Radio discipline is essential for the conduct of safe and effective formation
flight; therefore, visual signals are used whenever the situation allows.
These signals are the same as those used in other aircraft and are listed in
AFI 11-205 and in section H of this workbook.

When using visual signals for changing radio frequencies, additional
information is required to determine whether the change is meant for
radio 1 or radio 2. This is often prebriefed before flight if visual radio
frequency changes are anticipated. In the situation where a flight
member becomes “lost” on a particular radio frequency drill, it should be
obvious which radio is referenced.

LOST WINGMAN PROCEDURES
General

Execution of lost wingman procedures is principally an instrument
procedure, which should be initiated upon losing sight of lead, or if unable
to maintain formation due to spatial disorientation (SD). Lost wingman
procedures listed below are extracted from AFI 11-2F-15E, Vol 3,

Chapter 7. Note that the procedures while operating with a tanker are
different (refer to TO 1-1C-1-25).

@ Review lost wingman procedures before any mission involving night or
IMC.

@ Practicing lost wingman procedures (only VFR) is a good idea to see
the spacing obtained.

@ Do not penetrate dense cloud conditions unnecessarily in close
formation. Try radar trail formation or separate clearances. If you are
flying as a two-ship formation, the wingman usually has an easier time
if he flies on the right side of the formation.

OPS-4 D - 22


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_29.jpeg:
When you are flying on the wing, keep up with the navigation and
listen closely to clearances. Crosscheck your attitude whenever
feasible. When you anticipate entering the weather on the wing,
selecting an ADI on the MPD in the direction of lead allows you to
easily crosscheck attitude while flying formation. Maintain “situation
awareness.” Anticipate going “lost wingman.” Trim the aircraft and
concentrate on smooth, relaxed throttle and stick movements.

Notify the other crew member and the flight leader if you are
experiencing spatial disorientation. They may be able to establish a
wings-level attitude to clear your head, or give you the lead to allow
you to fly instruments for a short time.

When you can no longer maintain visual reference with your leader’s
aircraft in the briefed formation position, go lost wingman without
hesitation.

When you execute lost wingman procedures, smoothly transition to
your instruments and make the radio call when conditions permit.
Establish lateral, vertical and nose-tail clearance in a prompt but
controlled manner, and then stabilize your aircraft under instrument
flight conditions. Once you initiate the procedures, carry through until
you have control of your aircraft. Do not attempt to rejoin without
clearance from your flight leader!

Lead or aircraft with operational radio will obtain a separate clearance
for the remaining formation.

NORDO lost wingman will fly previous clearance and turn IFF/SIF to

NORMAL code 7600. If an emergency arises with radio failure, turn
the IFF/SIF to EMERGENCY for the remainder of the flight.

TACTICAL FORMATION
General

The standard combat formation employed by tactical fighters is the four-
ship flight. Within this formation, the two-ship element is the basic
fighting unit. The purpose of tactical formation is to combine firepower in
a disciplined, coordinated unit while providing mutual support against
threats. The various elements of the combat arena (weather, threats,
mission, flight size, etc.) determine the optimum position and role of each
flight member. The formations described here are applicable to both A/A
and A/S operations. As the tactical situation changes, positions,
responsibilities and maneuvering techniques change as well.

Formation Selection

Several criteria are addressed when selecting the best tactical formation
for a given mission.

@ Role/mission objectives

@ Threats-air and surface

@ Flight size

@ Flight leader/wingman capabilities

@ Ordnance capability versus air threats

@ Ordnance/fuel load—maneuvering capability
@ Tactics—low or medium altitude

@ Surface attack tactics/timing

@ Terrain

@ Weather-ceiling, visibility, TFR and FLIR
@ Support assets-GCI, EW, SEAD

@® Communication ROE-comm out, comm jamming

Visual Lookout

Formation Design

A tactical formation provides an offensive capability against enemy
aircraft while maintaining security against attack. The formation
selected, therefore, must allow flight members to detect and maneuver
against an attack before the attacker can achieve a lethal position.

Search Responsibility

The number of aircraft and their position within the formation is designed
to cope with the expected threat. In all tactical formations, each flight
member has a definite visual search responsibility. Even though each
pilot/WSO concentrates on a different area, this does not preclude
searching other areas when tasking, threats or the environment requires
it.

Visual Search Techniques
Limiting Factors

The threshold of visual detection depends upon factors such as aspect
angle, atmospheric conditions (haze, smoke, moisture), background, and
the condition of the helmet visor and canopy. Detection of threats at
maximum distance requires an efficient visual search pattern. Focus at a
distance of approximately 5 miles. With this focal point, the depth of FOV
approximates a range of 1 mile to infinity.

Focus Technique

Focus by initially viewing an object at the approximate detection range,
usually the ground. Once focused, various search patterns are used
(vertical, horizontal, etc.) depending upon individual preference.

However, no more than a 30° segment of the search area is scanned at one
time. After 20 to 30 seconds of searching empty sky, the eye focal distance
drifts back to a point less than 10 feet away. Before this occurs, refocus
and search another segment. Using these techniques, the aircrew can
establish a definite visual search pattern instead of random gazing.
Reference to canopy code and F-15E cockpit visibility charts can also
improve visual lookout techniques (Figures D-11 through D-14).

Basic Lookout Rules

@ Each crew member searches the entire FOV around his aircraft with
special emphasis on briefed areas of individual responsibility (See
Figure D-15).

@ The particular formation dictates the areas of responsibility (including
moving the aircraft to search blind spots).

@ Do not concentrate lookout near the horizontal plane of the formation.

© Do not forget the requirement to search 12:00, especially with the
advent of all-aspect enemy weapon systems. The HUD drives visual
concentration to the TD box. The F-15E pilot must guard against
channelizing visual attention on the TD box; instead the pilot must
search the full forward spectrum.

@ The use of a dark helmet visor or sunglasses may reduce visual
acquisition and detection range.

Two-Ship Tactical Formation

General

When planning the mission, the flight lead selects the best formation
(lateral spacing, vertical stack and wingman position) based on the threat,
tactics and maneuvering considerations. Different flight leaders brief a
given formation differently. Only the general concepts are described here.
Each unit has its own standards for tactical formation, and individual
flight leads add their specific requirements to meet the mission or training
objectives.

Maneuverability

Maneuverability is dependent upon:
@ Position and flight members’ ability.
@ Type of formation:

e Line abreast is best for visual mutual support, but it sacrifices some
maneuverability.

e Wedge formations are more maneuverable with the wingman
protecting lead, allowing lead to maneuver aggressively, but it
sacrifices some mutual support. Wedge is good in poor visibility
and at low altitude, where terrain blocks the bandit’s approach
avenues.

spacing as briefed or locally prescribed/restricted.

Stack vertically at 2000-5000 feet or as briefed or locally
prescribed/restricted.

When a trend toward a parameter limit is detected, use power/altitude as
necessary to correct.

@ If high approaching aft limit, unload and trade altitude for airspeed to
reach fore/aft position with enough power to allow slow climb back to
altitude parameter. Converse to move aft.

@ If too close or too wide, use small heading changes. Keep track of

lead’s heading by listening, accurately noting new heading to turn to
and relative position of your fuselage to lead’s.

Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_44.jpeg:
Advantages

Line abreast formation provides both aircraft optimum visual
cross-coverage and good position for rapid maneuvering and mutual
support to counter an attack. It diminishes the opportunity for a ground
threat to be alerted by the leader’s overflight and carry out a successful
engagement of the wingman. This formation also makes it easy for the
leader to check the wingman’s position and status.

Disadvantages

If the flight leader does not keep relatively strict formation parameters
(heading and airspeed), he/she forces the wingman to devote excessive
time to maintaining position instead of visual/radar search.

At low altitude, more of the responsibilities of maintaining formation
position shift to the WSO, reducing his/her ability to operate systems and
check six. At very low altitudes, line abreast formation is impractical to
fly because the position of the wingman does not allow adequate terrain
avoidance and maintenance of the assigned formation position.

Two-Ship Wedge

Wingman is 30-70° aft of lead's 3/9 line (Figure D-17) and 4000-9000 feet

This formation provides enhanced maneuverability at the expense of
visual and firepower support for the wingman.

Wingman is in a more flexible position to cover lead’s six.

Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_46.jpeg:
Advantages

The primary advantage of wedge formation is both the leader and
wingman are free to maneuver aggressively. This is an extremely
offensive formation lending itself to a split-plane entry into a visual fight.
The wingman has more flexibility in maintaining position and also has
more time to employ the radar. The formation can be flown at very low
altitudes because the wingman keeps lead in sight, while adequately
scanning approaching terrain.

Disadvantages
A disadvantage of wedge formation is the wingman has little help in
clearing six. There is less flexibility in reacting to attacks aft of the 3-9

line, and, because more time must be devoted to checking six, other
wingman responsibilities may suffer.

Two-Ship Fluid Formation

Fluid formation is defined as the wingman positioned within a cone 30° to
70° aft of the leader’s 3/9 line, with lateral spacing normally 1000 to 4000
feet (Figure D-18). Arenas for use include holding in a tactical
environment or maneuvering around obstacles or clouds. This formation
is employed by elements when flying fluid four.

Advantages

This formation allows the element to maintain flight integrity while
holding, under marginal conditions, or in rough terrain.

Disadvantages
A disadvantage of fluid formation is the poor to nonexistent mutual

6 o'clock visual coverage. This formation allows for easy detection by a
single threat.

Tactical Turns

Basic maneuvering requires check turns, delayed 90°, 45° and in-place
180° or cross 180° turns. Turns may be signaled by lead’s turns, wing
flashes or called on the radio. All flight members must maintain a
disciplined visual search.

Check Turn

A check turn is a simultaneous turn by both fighters to a heading 45° or
less from the original heading (Figure D-19). This turns a flight in a
desired direction, or regains line abreast positioning when a specific
heading is not important. A check turn is usually used to signal a turn
when at low altitude below 5000 feet. At medium altitudes, a wing flash
may be used by some flight leads. At medium altitude, after a check turn
in which line abreast positioning is lost, the vertical is used to regain line
abreast. At low altitude, the aircraft in front maneuvers as required to
regain line abreast.

OPS-04-19

Figure D - 19. Check Turn.

OPS-4 D - 42


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_49.jpeg:
Line Abreast Turns

The general contract for line abreast is:
@ The wingman always strives for line abreast.
@ The wingman stays within 90° of lead’s heading.

@ Turns are made in MIL power and airspeed is maintained. Four G
turns at low altitude or buffet onset at medium altitude may be used
for the duration of the turn.

@ All turns are assumed to be 90°.
Delayed Turns

The delayed turn is used to turn a line abreast formation while
maintaining maximum mutual support and lookout. It allows both the
new and old 6:00 areas to be searched. Visual cross-coverage and mutual
support are momentarily degraded as the outside F-15E is crossing in
trail, but are regained when the turn is complete.

The leader initiates the delayed 90° turn using a prebriefed signal,
generally a radio call or a wing flash.

At low altitude, lead may substitute a 30° check turn for the wing flash to
signal turns away from the wingman. The check turn is at 3-4 Gs to
preclude it being mistaken for a belly check or minor navigation
correction. If the turn is into the wingman, lead initiates a 3-4 G turn to
the new heading, the same as at medium altitude. The wingman checks
30° away, maintains heading until lead crosses six, then completes his
turn to roll-out line abreast.

Turns Away From The Wingman: Lead initiates the turn. If check turns
are utilized, lead checks away from the wingman. The wingman turns
into lead (Figure D-21, Left and Right).

For 45° turns, lead turns back into the wingman as the wingman turns
approximately 45°. The wingman rolls out as lead turns into the
wingman. Lead crosses the wingman's flight path and maneuvers to line
abreast and/or the new heading. The wingman then maneuvers to correct
the line abreast formation.

For 90° turns, lead begins when the wingman is pointing at him, or if a
check turn was used when the wingman passes lead’s six.

D- 45 OPS-4


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_52.jpeg:
In-Place Turn

A turn away from the wingman does not require a call since lead keeps
turning. Generally, the in-place turn (Figure D-22) is used to quickly turn
a line abreast formation 180°. When the flight lead signals, both aircraft
simultaneously execute a turn at prebriefed parameters (power setting, G-
loading, airspeed) to the desired heading.

A radio call is usually made for a turn into the wingman, otherwise the
wingman would assume a delayed turn. If the turn is to the right, the
aircraft on the right leads the turn for 90°, with the fighter on the left
matching the turn and maintaining proper flight path clearance. At the
90° point, responsibilities switch as relative positions (right and left)
change.

NEW SIX

OLDISIX OPS-04-22

Figure D - 22. In-Place Turns.

In-place turns are also used for other than 180° heading reversals. For
example, they are used to convert to or from a trail/staggered position to
line abreast. If roll-out is to be other than 180°, a radio call is made and
the loss of line abreast positioning at roll-out is to be anticipated.

The primary advantage of an in-place turn is that it gets all aircraft
turned around in minimum time with the proper spacing.

The primary disadvantage is the loss of visual cross-coverage on the
trailing fighter during the turn.

OPS-4 D - 46


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_53.jpeg:
Cross Turn

This turn is another 180° reversal option. The fighters turn into each
other, with altitude split for flight path deconfliction (Figure D-23).
Maneuvering is also out of the horizontal plane to decrease effective turn
radius if the threat arena permits. At low altitude the wingman should
fly above the leader’s flight path.

NEW SIX

OLD SIX

OPS-04-23

Figure D - 23. Cross Turn.

Use of the vertical helps maintain proper spacing on roll-out, but in
general, some sort of follow-on maneuver, such as a check turn or a
shackle, is necessary to regain proper spacing. The formation is
vulnerable after the fighters pass due to the loss of visual cross-coverage
(belly-side) and mutual support potential. In a very low altitude
environment, the cross turn is difficult to perform due to the need for
vertical maneuvering to avoid excessive spacing and prevent collisions. In
all cases, the wingman deconflicts his flight path from the flight leader.

D - 47 OPS-4


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_54.jpeg:
Shackle

This maneuver is used to get the wingman on the required side or to
adjust for excessive spacing. It is often used after 180° turns (especially
cross turns), or to establish a new reference heading (Figure D-24). A
weave is a continuous shackle.

Weaving can be used on egress to help check six and can be prebriefed or
called as the situation dictates.

OPS-04-24

Figure D - 24. Shackle.

Procedures for a shackle:

@ Simultaneous turns by both aircraft toward each other within 30-45° of
reference heading.

@ Cross to maintain mutual support and lookout.
@ Delay turn back momentarily after crossing to obtain proper spacing.
If Number Two is in trail, a weave by lead would mean for Two to

maintain heading while lead restabilizes line abreast. A check turn by
lead with Two in trail would be a signal for an in place 90° turn.

OPS-4 D - 48


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_55.jpeg:
Wedge Turns

Wedge formations are more maneuverable since the wingman generally
has time to react to the leader’s maneuvers. The wingman uses fluid
maneuvering to stay in wedge formation as lead turns (Figure D-25).

A delay is required if the wingman is on the inside of lead’s turn.
Normally, this delay forces the wingman to switch sides.

During turns away, the wingman maneuvers as soon as he perceives a
heading change greater than 40°. When lead turns away from the
wingman and rolls out with the wingman at six, trail formation results.
For example, a 45° check turn away from a wingman in 45° wedge leaves
no maneuver options for the wingman other than to split altitude, or use
power to reposition.

INTO WINGMAN

AWAY FROM WINGMAN

OPS-04-25

Figure D - 25. Turns in Wedge Formation.

Visual search responsibilities during maneuvering require the leader to
check the old six area as lead turns. The wingman clears the new six area
of lead until stabilized on course.

The 180° turns from wedge formation require the wingman to use fluid
maneuvering and reposition in formation on the reciprocal heading.

D - 49 OPS-4


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_56.jpeg:
Formation positions are usually not rigid and the wingman may need to
close up spacing for weather or terrain clearance. If conditions require
rejoining to maintain the formation, wingmen request permission and are
cleared by lead.

Four-Ship Tactical Formation

This basic fighting formation concentrates firepower, increases mutual
support and multiplies options.

The four-ship formation is under control of one flight lead and is employed
as a single entity until forced to separate into two elements. An element
should never sacrifice element integrity attempting to maintain the four-
ship formation. Each two-ship element has its own radar and visual plan
so no changes are required if the four-ship is split into two separate two-
ships.

Visual Search

Each element maintains a visual lookout pattern as described under
two-ship fluid formation. Number Three positions the second element off
the flight leader.

Maneuvering

Number Three maneuvers off the flight lead as if in line abreast, and
usually stays high for deconfliction. Numbers Two and Four maneuver off
their element leaders, as in fluid, to maintain position on the outside of
the formation. Visual responsibilities remain the same. Flight path
deconfliction, especially in altitude, is more critical.

Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_62.jpeg:
Advantages

Concentration of firepower.

The lead element is offensively oriented while the rear element
provides defensive coverage in addition to their offensive potential.

Formation maneuvering potential is good, with element spacing for an
attack built into the formation.

The formation potentially masks the actual number of aircraft from
enemy GCI/AWACS.

Disadvantages

The trail element must devote a significant amount of time to
maintaining visual contact with the lead element. A/A TACAN (if
emission control allows) and/or AAI are useful for the trailing element
to maintain desired spacing.

The trailing element may be momentarily mistaken as a threat. The
trailing element should not lock onto the lead element for ranging
information unless absolutely required, and then should give a “Buddy
Lock” call when this occurs.

Visual Search

Responsibilities are essentially the same as two-ship line abreast.
However, both elements need to remain aware of the other element’s
position.

Maneuvering

The elements use line abreast maneuvering with Number Three
maneuvering off the lead element. The trail element’s proximity aids in
mutual lookout, defensive reaction and coordination during the intercept
phase.

Other Tactical Formations

AFTTP 3-3 explains other tactical formations not covered in this
workbook. They include:

2-3 nm trail. Useful for TFR and FLIR operations.
Arrowhead (a variation of box).

Three-ship VIC, line abreast and trail.

Low Altitude

Fly line abreast at or above 300 feet AGL.

Below 300 feet AGL, wedge is recommended.

Below 1000 feet AGL, wingman (element) is no lower than lead.
Aircraft in front is responsible to get the element back to line abreast.
Crossing steep or hilly terrain, maintain positive G and use no more
than 120° of bank. Maneuvering at less than 1 G is limited to upright

bunting maneuvers.

Maintain a minimum airspeed of 300 KIAS or minimum TF, whichever
is higher.

If ever unable to devote sufficient time to terrain clearance tasks, climb
out of the low altitude structure.

D-57 OPS-4


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_64.jpeg:
Collision Avoidance

@ Collision avoidance is the responsibility of the wingman during
formation maneuvering. Unless directed otherwise by the flight lead,
wingmen maneuver to keep lead in sight and normally deconflict high
and to the outside.

@ There are times when the primary responsibility for deconfliction
transfers to the flight lead.

e When turn geometry forces a wingman to lose visual contact during
formation defensive reaction to a threat

e When a wingman calls “Blind”
e When a wingman calls “Padlocked”

@ Primary responsibility transfers back to the wingman after the
wingman regains a visual on lead. Although tactical formations are
spread generally to allow flexibility of wingman maneuvers, the
differences in responsibilities between the leader and the wingman
demand there be no confusion over roles. Lead changes are usually
made using the radio.

FORMATION INTRODUCTION
Requirement

Formation flying is required for the efficient employment of the F-15E in
the air-to-surface or air-to-air roles. During combat operations, formation
is required for coordinated offensive maneuvering, mutual support and
survivability; therefore, formation discipline is essential.

The Basic Fighting Unit

The basic fighting unit is the two-ship element (Figure D-1). The leader is
responsible for briefing, selecting tactics and employing the flight within
its capabilities to carry out the assigned mission. The wingman's main
duty is to fly the briefed formation and to support the leader at all times.

IN-FLIGHT DISTRESS SIGNALS

Table 2. In-Flight Distress Signals.

Approach End Cable Engagement a. Escorted: Extend tail hook. Escorting
aircraft with relay intent.
b. Unescorted: Fly parallel to the active
runway at 1000 feet above the field elevation
with tail hook extended. Rock wings until
reaching the departure end of the runway,
turn to downwind and check tower or mobile
control for light signals. If a straight-in cable
engagement must be flown, flash landing light
on final.

*Bailing Out or Ejection One or both clenched fists pulled downward
across the face to simulate pulling an ejection
face curtain.

Descend to Lower Altitude Hold hand at top of canopy, palm down,
fingers extended and joined, move hand
forward and down.

*Desire to Land Movement of the hand, flat, with palm down,
forward and downward, finishing the
movement in a simulated roundout. As an
alternate signal, lower the landing gear.

Electrical Failure Landing (No Assist Aircraft | Distressed aircraft will fly 500 feet over the

Available) tower or mobile control, then continue to the
far end of the runway and pull up into a wide
downward leg. Proceed with a landing and
pattern approach for the type of aircraft being
flown while watching the tower or mobile for
signals. The control tower will clear the area
of other aircraft and will call emergency crash
equipment to the scene.

I Must Land Immediately Close fist and hold it to top of canopy with
thumb extend downward, then move arm and
down rapidly. (Do not confuse with AGEAR
DOWNG signal, which is generally not used
with altitude.)

I Must Land on Your Wing Pat shoulder, palm down. To prevent
confusion with other signals, use right hand
and left shoulder or vice versa. To
acknowledge, other pilot must give the OK
signal; the basic signal indicates a jet
approach speed of 180 knots. If the distress
aircraft desires a higher approach speed, the
pilot must raise one finger for each 10 knot
increase desired. The distressed aircraft
lands and the escort executes a go around.

G-5 OPS-4


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_78.jpeg:
Table 2. (Cont=d)

Intercepting Signals The intercepting aircraft positions itself in
front of and usually to the left of the
intercepted aircraft and rocks its wings. This
is a signal that the interceptor wishes the
other aircraft to follow it. A responding
irregular flashing of all available lights in this
case indicates distress.

Radio Failure Tap microphone or earphone of helmet and
signal as appropriate:
a. Receive Failure: With palm of hand over
the ear position, move hand forward and
backward.
b. Transmitter Failure: With palm of hand
toward and in front of the face, move hand up
and down.

Radio Inoperative Landing (No Assist Aircraft | Fly aircraft along the side of the landing

Available) runway, 1000 feet above the field elevation,
rocking wings until reaching end of the
runway. Turn to downwind and check the
tower or mobile control for green light on base
leg and final approach for landing clearance.

System Failures (HEFOE System) Clench fist and hold it at top of canopy, then
hold up the required number of fingers to
denote which system is involved (see a
through e below). If the clenched fist signal is
seen but no finger signal is seen or the
intercepting pilot is unable to understand the
signal given, the pilot will assume the aircraft
in distress has one or more systems
inoperable and should proceed with caution.

System Failures (HEFOE System) The receiving pilot acknowledges the signal by
(Continued) repeating it:
a. HydraulicBone finger
b. ElectricalBtwo fingers
c. FuelBthree fingers
d. OxygenBfour fingers
e. EngineBfive fingers
NOTE: For multi-engine aircraft, point to the
side, left or right, that corresponds with the
engine failure.

NOTES:
1. For use only when radio is inoperative or not available.
2. Day visual signals.

NIGHT VISUAL SIGNALS

Table 3. Night Visual Signals.

Aircraft Emergency (Must Land As Soon As Signal escort aircraft by repeated intermittent

Possible) flashes with a flashlight, then assume the
wing position. This signal indicates a jet
approach speed of 130 knots. If a higher
approach speed is desired, the pilot must
pause after the basic signal, and then blink
flashlight at the top of the canopy, once for
each 10-knot increase desired. The escort
pilot will lead to the nearest suitable field,
declare an emergency with the controlling
agency, then fly a straight-in approach with
the distressed aircraft on the wing. The
distressed aircraft lands and the escort
executes a go around.
NOTE: On a straight-in approach, the escort
aircraft turns the position lights to bright, or
dim and steady as appropriate, to alert the
wingman to prepare to lower flaps and
landing gear. The corresponding signal of
execution will be for the lead aircraft to return
position lights to the original setting.
However, if the aircraft is equipped with only
a steady-bright light position, the lead aircraft
will blink lights for alerting signal of
execution.

Approach End Cable Engagement Fly parallel to active runway at 1000 feet
above field elevation with gear down and flash
landing light. Turn downwind and check
tower or mobile control for light signal. Ifa
straight-in cable engagement must be flown,
flash landing light on final.

Attention Attract attention by switching on the landing
light, or other means of illumination.

Change Lead Pilot of distressed aircraft holds flashlight
parallel with canopy rail and sends a steady
light while making a straight line from rear
toward the front of the canopy.

Descend to Lowest Practical Altitude Make a rapid vertical movement with a
flashlight.

Electrical Failure Landing (No Assist Aircraft | Procedure same as described for day visual

Available) signal in attachment 2.

Radio Inoperative Make a large circular motion with a
flashlight.

Radio Inoperative Landing Same as day signal procedures in
attachment 2.

Signal Acknowledgment Point a steady light from the flashlight at the
signaling aircraft.
