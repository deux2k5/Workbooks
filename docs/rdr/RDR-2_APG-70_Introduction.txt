Removes all power from the radar.

Initiates a three-minute warm-up period. A radar BIT is
performed during power up. At the end of that period, all
radar functions are operational except for transmitter high
voltage and RF transmissions. AIM-120 missile BIT is
performed (does not BIT training PACS missiles).

Full radar operation except on the ground (weight on
wheels [WOW] switch engaged). TUNE appears on the
MPD/MPCD until all AIM-7 missiles tune or the
120-second timer expires, whichever occurs first. If the
operator bypasses the STBY position, radar operation is
inhibited until the three-minute warm-up timer expires.

This position provides full radar operation. It bypasses all
protective interlocks, except the WOW switch, the
transmitter coolant flow interlocks and the three-minute
warm-up timer. Activation requires pulling the switch out
and rotating it to EMERG. Going to EMERG sets a white
flag to the right of the switch that requires maintenance
action to reset.

NOTE

Use of EMERG is not authorized for peacetime training missions.

MPD/MPCD Controls

As with any MPD/MPCD, you cannot control the display unless you are
‘in command” of that display. Display of “in command” lines on the
bottom of the MPD/MPCD and solid acq symbols indicate system control.
A “system in use” message indicates the other crew member is moving the
acq symbols or has locked-up/designated a target.

Elevation (EL) Scan Control

PB #2 controls the number of elevation bars (Figure D-4/D-5) that the
antenna covers during its raster search pattern. The bars have 1° spacing
in 40, 80 and 160 nm ranges. They have 2-1/2° spacing in 20 nm and 3.4°
spacing in 10 nm ranges. In TWS, elevation bar spacing is always 1.5°.
Current bar sweep (e.g., 3 for third) and PRF (HI or MED) appear on the
lower left corner of the display.

Frame Store (FS)

PB #8 (Figure D-5) specifies the number of old frames that a target
continues to appear on the screen. With frame store set at 3, a fast
moving target might appear as three old targets in trail, reduced in
intensity, along with the brightest current frame target. If displayed on
the MPCD, the most recent hit is white, the next blue and the last green.
Track-while-scan (TWS) frame store is automatically set at one.

Ground Moving Target Rejection (GMTR)

PB #4 (Figure D-5) allows selection of a 45 to 95 knot filter around main
beam clutter in medium PRF (i.e., RWS-M). LO provides +45 knots of
moving target rejection as long as the antenna elevation is less than +3°
lookup. (For angles greater than +3° look up, clutter rejection is + 10
knots with GMTR LO selected.) GMTR MED provides +63 knots of target
rejection, and GMTR HI provides +87 knots of rejection. Each setting
successively reduces the possibility of ground moving targets causing
unwanted returns on the display. GMTR CHAF selects a special MPRF
mechanization, which provides 95 knots of GMT rejection and an airborne
beam notch of +95 knots.

Vis-Ident (VI)

The VI legend is located at PB #5 when in single target track (STT)
(Figure D-5). VI, when selected, provides fighter steering to a visual
identification position directly behind the target. It can be used from any
aspect set up. The VI legend is not available during “Flood,” VS, BST and
Gun Modes. The GUN, SRM and MRM launch circuits are operational in
VI. The weapons symbology is not.

Range Gate High (RGH)

The RGH mode at PB #7 (Figure D-7) employs an intermediate PRF
between MPRF and HPRF and allows detection of both front and tail
aspect targets with good ranging accuracy and sorting capability. It
reverts back to INLV when aircraft altitude is less than 4000 feet AGL.
RGH is boxed when selected.

VS

Pressing PB #8 (Figure D-7) selects VS (velocity search), a pure doppler
HPRF mode. There is no ranging available in this mode and the display
format is azimuth and velocity. With VS selected (boxed), pressing PB #8
again brings up and boxes VCTR (vector scan). Vector scan also uses
HPRF, but with FM ranging. The VCTR display format is azimuth and
range. VCTR changes the antenna scan rate to facilitate detecting small
radar cross section (RCS) targets.

Text from RDR-2_APG-70_Introduction_page_16.jpeg:
ENTER

Enter at PB #10 (Figure D-8) presets certain air-to-air search parameters
based on MRM or SRM selection. To use this feature, first select MRM or
SRM at the weapon select switch, and then choose the parameters you
desire for that mode. Selectable radar parameters are bar scan, range and
radar mode (e.g., INLV). After selecting the desired radar parameters,
press ENTER. Selecting MRM or SRM on the weapon select switch
(forward or aft on RCP castle switch) will initialize the radar to those
specific parameters. Other radar parameters such as frame store,
azimuth and GMTR are not programmable with PB #10, but will be as
last selected. The MC/DTM may also be used to program radar
parameters.

FLOOD

Selecting Flood at PB #13 (Figure D-8) is a MPRF ranging only mode that
provides gun LCOS track funnel ranging out to 2 nm as long as the target
is maintained in the flood antenna beam (16° wide/40° vertical, centered
on W). Other flood modes will be covered in subsequent lessons.

Acquisition (Acq) Symbol

The acq symbol is a pair of vertical lines with space between them (Figure
D-10). The crew member moves the acq symbol with the TDC; the acq
symbol is used to position the lock-on gate (volume) on the radar display
or to sample/highlight targets in search/TWS. Manual lock on is obtained
by placing the acq symbol over the target and depressing and releasing
the FCP TDC or the RCP trigger. This lock on is called single target track
(STT).

D-11 RDR-2


Text from RDR-2_APG-70_Introduction_page_18.jpeg:
The acquisition symbol is available during STT when medium range
missile (MRM) is selected on the weapon select switch. The acquisition
symbol is not available in STT when short range missile (SRM) or gun is
selected on the weapon select switch.

Besides using the acq symbol for lock on, the crew member can use the acq
symbol to command azimuth or range “bumping.” Bumping the side of the
display changes the azimuth scan between 60° and 120° (azimuth
bumping not available in STT). Bumping the top of the screen changes to
the next higher range. Bumping the bottom changes to the next lower
range. Range bumping is available in STT; however, once range bumping
is used, automatic range scale change is no longer available (auto range
scale change will return when MRM is deselected in STT). Also, once in
STT with MRM selected, the CC will not honor a range bump to a range
scale smaller than the STT target’s current range.

A slow/fast cue (target speed greater than or equal to 1.1 Mach, or less
than or equal to 0.4 Mach) will appear to the right of the target in STT or
to the right of the acquisition symbol when the target is sampled with the
acq symbol in TWS. Acquisition symbol sampling of the target will also
recall NCTR data.

C Altitude Searching

The two numbers shown to the right of the acquisition symbol
indicate the altitude block being searched. The altitude block
numbers represent the coverage at the range of the acq symbol. The
numbers represent the top and bottom of the coverage in thousands
of feet MSL. Altitude coverage circles are also displayed on the left
edge of the grid for a graphic depiction of the top and bottom of the
elevation coverage. The center of the scale (0° or level) corresponds to
0 feet. The top of the scale (60°) corresponds to 60,000 feet. When
the acq symbol is placed over a target in search, a digital MSL
altitude is displayed left of the acq symbol and an altitude "coffin"
appears within the altitude coverage circles, both more precisely
defining the target's altitude.

D_ Range Displayed

The range of the display (10, 20, 40, 80 or 160 nm) appears at the top
right corner. The inscribed lines represent 25%, 50% and 75% of the
total range.

search operation when jamming is detected. The HOJ and JAM cues
are displayed during track operation.

F Destination Symbol

Assuming the current steer point is within the swept area of the
display, it appears as an unmarked, full intensity, open triangle. Up
to 5 additional steer points may be displayed (i.e., current plus next
5). These appear as 3/4 intensity, open triangles labeled with their
appropriate sequence point number.

G Range Limited Targets

In search, the radar processes targets beyond the displayed target
range and displays a range limited target at the top of the display.
The symbol is a tall, skinny, open triangle which, after one frame,
will be at half-intensity. These resolved targets are within 10 nm of
the display range and are shown at their correct azimuth.

H Bullseye Bearing and Range (BBR) and Symbol

The Bullseye symbol (a small dot with a circle around it) is displayed
on the air-to-air radar display in search if it is within the radar sweep
area. If a destination symbol and the bullseye point are at the same
location, then both will be displayed and super-imposed. A digital
readout of bearing and range from the bullseye point (whether
symbol is on A/A radar display or not) to either the STT target or acq
symbol (if not in STT) is shown to the right of the F-15E ground speed
readout on the A/A radar display. Bullseye data may be blanked in
some radar modes (e.g., Flood).

I Display of Bearing, Range and Altitude (BRA)

In addition to existing altitude information (coffin in search or digital
altitude readout in search and track), bearing and range information
from the F-15E to the acquisition symbol/tracked target is available
to the aircrew. This information is a digital readout in the upper left
corner of the A/A radar display (to the left of channel-band selection).
Bearing is above range and is in degrees (5 degree increments)
relative to Magnetic North, with leading zeroes. Range is in one
nautical mile increments without leading zeroes.

HOTAS Controls
FCP Stick

The auto acquisition switch (Figure D-16) is the only switch on the FCP
stick that controls the radar. It is spring loaded to center and has three
other positions: forward, aft and down. From radar search, the switch
commands radar auto acquisition supersearch (SS), boresight (BST), long
range boresight (LR BST) and vertical scan (VTS). When in search, the
down position (mode reject or return to search (RTS)) can be used to clear
the radar display (erase the targets). In radar track, the switch
commands TWS variations. Forward selects high data TWS (HD-TWS)
and aft selects normal TWS (N-TWS). In TWS, forward alternately cycles
(toggles) HD-TWS/N-TWS. Aft from any TWS mode toggles STT/N-TWS.

Elevation (EL) Wheel

The elevation wheel is a spring-centered, round switch located on the left
side of the left throttle. The wheel allows control of the vertical pointing
angle (space stabilized relative to INS horizon) of the radar antenna in
search. Moving the wheel from center causes the radar antenna vertical
angle to move up or down. The farther the switch is held from center, the
faster the antenna vertical angle changes. Rotating the front of the wheel
upward causes the radar antenna to move upward. Down on the wheel
moves the antenna downward. Since radar elevation coverage is
determined by the vertical pointing angle of the antenna, the control
switch is called the elevation wheel instead of some other name. Vertical
pointing angle remains centered on the target upon exit from STT or TWS
back to search. However, the vertical pointing angle is initialized to zero
(INS horizon) upon exit from SS, BST, LR BST or VTS search patterns to
normal search patterns by RTS (mode reject). During GUNS auto acq
search pattern, mode reject will return the scan pattern to the INS
horizon centerline.

D-19 RDR-2


Text from RDR-2_APG-70_Introduction_page_26.jpeg:
TDC

The TDC positions the acquisition symbol on the radar display. The acq
symbol moves in the same direction as the TDC moves. Depressing and
releasing the TDC commands target lockon from search (FCP only).
Depressing the TDC for greater than one second commands the narrow
azimuth scan sort mode from search or track. The TDC also positions the
radar's scan center in either supersearch or gun mode. If in radar search
with less than full gimbal azimuth sweep, the TDC will adjust the sweep
center left and right (the sweep center is centered on the acq symbol).

Coolie Switch

This switch (Figure D-17) is at the right front corner of the right throttle.
In addition to the spring loaded neutral position, it has the following four

positions:

UP

DOWN
INBOARD

OUTBOARD

RDR-2

This quick steps (moves) from one designated TWS
target to the next (other TWS actions covered later).
If gun is selected and a radar lock is achieved, it
cycles between GDS and GDS funnel modes. It
selects highlight and combined modes.

This is a missile boresight/gunsight stiffen position.
This activates the EID/EWWS/NCTR.

This activates the AAI.

Castle Switch

In addition to a spring-loaded neutral position (off), this switch has
five-positions: left, right, forward, aft and down.

LEFT Undesignates a track-while-scan target.

RIGHT Rejects the missile currently selected.

FORWARD Initiates LRS (MRM) programmed radar search
parameters/mode.

AFT Initiates SRS (SRM) programmed radar search
parameters/mode.

DOWN Quick steps from one TWS designated target to
another (other TWS actions covered later). Selects
highlight mode.

TDC

This controls the acquisition symbol, just like the FCP TDC. When used
with half action on the trigger, it controls the elevation coverage of the
radar by adjusting the antenna vertical pointing angle.

Interrogate Switch

This is a three-position button on the outboard side of the right hand
controller (Figure D-19) spring loaded to the center-off position. It
activates AAI when moved forward, and EID/EWWS/NCTR functions
when moved aft.

Countermeasures Dispenser (CMD) Switch

The CMD switch is located on the outboard side of the left hand controller
(Figure D-20). Forward starts the Manual 1 program and aft starts the
Manual 2 program. The switch is spring loaded to the center (off)
position.

Coolie Switch

This switch scrolls and takes command of the displays in the RCP.

Auto Acquisition

Pressing down on the auto acq button returns the radar to search.
Antenna elevation remains that of the target from STT and TWS. Auto
acq forward or aft for less than 1 second may be used to return the
antenna vertical pointing angle to the INS horizon (elevation caret to zero)
and the azimuth to centerline. All other positions control specific track
functions. The radar auto acquisition modes cannot be commanded from
the rear cockpit. When in search, the down position (mode reject) clears
the radar display (erases the targets or birds). TWS functions are
identical to those described for the front cockpit auto acquisition button.

F-15E BIT CHECKS
Initiated BIT (I-BIT) Checks

Normally, the aircrew should accomplish an I-BIT (with track test) on the
radar before every flight. After the I-BIT, the aircrew will be fully aware
of radar system status and its capabilities. If the radar does not work
properly in flight, include the results of an airborne

I-BIT in the maintenance write up.

Procedures to start an I-BIT on the ground or airborne are displayed in
Figure D-23. The radar power knob must be in STBY or ON with the
radar warmed up. Display the radar on a separate MPD/MPCD. When
the radar is warmed up, the azimuth caret will ~ sweeping.

On initial ground startup, with the radar power knob in STBY and the
radar warmed up, run the STBY I-BIT prior to turning the radar to ON to
ensure the integrity of the WOW switch. I-BIT is started as mentioned in
Figure D-23. The aircrew BIT matrix will be displayed on the radar
display. If GND appears at the bottom right of the aircrew BIT matrix
display (Figure D-24), the aircrew can be confident that the radar will not
transmit while on the ground when the radar power is turned on.

The aircrew BIT matrix remains displayed until you proceed to the
maintenance BIT matrix, or until you reject it by pressing down on the
auto acq switch.

The aircrew BIT matrix (Figure D-24) lists those radar functions that
failed the BIT and shows any RF channels that are bad. The
three-character designation following “MDC” in the lower right corner
indicates which radar software (OFP) version is being used. In this case,
DAT is the current radar OFP version.

After the STBY I-BIT matrix pages have been checked, place the radar
power knob to ON, wait for the AIM-7 tune cycle to finish and the radar
display to begin azimuth sweeping. At this point, start another I-BIT.
SELECT OPTION appears after starting the radar I-BIT (Figure D-26).
Moving the auto acq switch forward or aft once starts the radar’s track
test. Failure to select track test during the time SELECT OPTION is
displayed allows the radar to continue the initiated BIT without a track
test.

During track test, check the radar's tracking functions. You should lock
on to both medium and high PRF targets to check out the tracking
circuits. Also check manual and auto acquisition modes.

The I-BIT takes approximately 90 seconds by itself. The track test may be
maintained as long as desired, and when terminated, the I-BIT continues
to completion. Normally, all of the radar BIT procedures can be
accomplished in 3-4 minutes.

F-15E RADAR SEARCH MODES

During radar surveillance, there are three operational phases: detection,
acquisition and tracking. In the search or detection phase, the
fundamental concern is optimizing radar parameters to detect both long
and short range targets. Common terms for these conditions are long
range search (LRS) and short range search (SRS). These are also referred
to as MRM search and SRM search. By presetting the APG-70 radar,
detection sensitivity to long range, front aspect target detection is
optimized. Likewise, in the SRS, detection capability is optimized by
presetting the radar mode for short range maneuvering targets.

PB #6 on the MPD selects the LRS or SRS radar modes normally used.
These are INLV and MED. These RWS modes can be preset to coincide
with the selection of either MRM or SRM on the weapon select switch.
For example, normally the aircrew programs the radar to initialize in
MED when selecting SRM or INLV when selecting MRM. Once
programmed by the aircrew (or MC/DTM), LRS or SRS parameters can
also be selected by toggling the RCP castle switch forward (LRS) or aft
(SRS) while in command of the A/A radar display.

Long Range Search Mode (Primary)

Range While Search-Interleaved (INLV)

During normal LRS conditions, INLV is the basic air-to-air surveillance
mode. In INLV the radar operates in an interleaved (alternating high and
medium) PRF. For example, the first bar of the radar's transmission is
high PRF (radar bit window reads “HI”) and the second bar is medium
PRF (radar bit window reads “MED”). Alternating PRF maximizes target
detection capabilities under most tactical conditions. In other words,
interleaved gives maximum capability to detect front aspect targets at
long range and all-aspect targets at short range.

Although INLV is normally high and medium interleaved PRF, the radar
employs only MPRF (radar bit window reads “MED”) waveform with

10 nm range selected. With 160 mile range selected, the radar employs
either HPRF (radar BIT window reads “HA”) or interleaved PRF
waveform (radar BIT window alternates “HI” and “MED”), selectable by
alternate acq symbol range bumps against the top of the A/A radar
display.

D- 35 RDR-2


Text from RDR-2_APG-70_Introduction_page_42.jpeg:
Advantages

Interleaved combines the advantages of both high and medium PRF. It
gives the capability to detect long range high aspect targets. It also gives
the capability to detect all-aspect short range targets.

Disadvantages

INLV is a poor sort mode. Because of the different methods used to
determine range (either HPRF or MPRF), it is possible to see different
ranges for the same target.

Limitations

At maximum ranges, there are FM ranging limitations. MPRF detection
is not available at long ranges.

Short Range Search Mode (Primary)

Range While Search-Medium (MED)

This mode is good for a short range, look-down, cluttered environment. It
will detect both opening and closing velocity targets by using an all MPRF
waveform. Compared to INLV, this mode provides better breakout
capability. However, long range performance is less than that in LRS
modes (160 nm range not available). Target sort capability and range
resolution is better when compared to those in HPRF.

Advantage

The biggest advantage of this mode is its all-aspect target detection
capability.

Disadvantage

There are blind zones in the detection pattern.

RDR-2 D - 36


Text from RDR-2_APG-70_Introduction_page_43.jpeg:
Limitations

The limited range against small targets is the biggest limitation of MED.
The max range for a small target is approximately 40 nm.

Other Search Modes

Range While Search-HIGH (HI)

Unlike INLV, HI transmission is all-HPRF waveform (radar BIT window
reads “HI”). This mode, under certain tactical conditions, allows longer
detection ranges than does INLV. Basically, these tactical conditions are
look-up and look-down for front aspect targets. The HI mode will
normally not detect tail aspect targets. This means that detecting a
maneuvering, long range target, is best done in INLV not HI.

Advantage

The greatest advantage of this mode is long range pickup. It aligns more
with a doppler mode than other RWS modes.

Disadvantage

The disadvantages of this mode are similar to the disadvantages of
doppler radars. HPRF search is not normally usable against beam and
tail aspect targets.

Limitations

The limitation of this mode is FM ranging.

Range-Gated High (RGH) Mode

The RGH mode employs an intermediate PRF falling between MPRF and
HPRF and allows detection of both frontal and tail aspect targets with
good ranging accuracy and sorting capability. A slower scan rate
(50°/second) and long pulse waveform are used in the 40, 80 and 160 nm
range scales. The 10 and 20 nm range scales use a 70°/second scan rate
and short-pulse waveform to increase target breakout capability.

D - 37 RDR-2


Text from RDR-2_APG-70_Introduction_page_44.jpeg:
INLV is automatically invoked when F-15E altitude drops below 4000 feet
AGL and special mode E-1 is selected in order to reduce false targets.
When F-15E altitude is increased above 4500 feet AGL, normal RGH
operations resume.

Advantage

Longer range all aspect contacts.

Disadvantage

Detection range for front aspect targets is less than HPRF. Tail aspect
performance is limited on cospeed or tail closing targets. A slower scan
rate increases the time to search a volume of airspace.

Limitation

Aircraft altitude must be above 4000 feet AGL to use RGH mode. Target
maneuvering is difficult to see due to the slower scan rate.

Velocity Search (VS) Mode

The third LRS mode, velocity search, is the only pure doppler mode found
in the F-15E. The operator selects VS by pushing PB #8 on the MPD. The
VS mode is a nonranging HPRF waveform and is strictly for long range,
front aspect detection. The waveform in VS is more sensitive than the
waveform found in the HI mode; therefore, initial target detection should
be greater using VS. Presentation of target information on the display is
in terms of target relative ground speed (radial velocity) versus azimuth
(Figure D-28). Target relative ground speed (TRGS) is that component of
the target ground speed directly toward (away) from ownship.

In VS, the target must be a front aspect target with 80 to approximately
2400 knots of positive TRGS. For example, VS is the best search mode to
use for high, fast flyers like the Foxbat. Once a VS lock on is achieved, the
radar will continue to attempt to resolve range. When it does, the VS
track will automatically transfer to normal STT.

Advantage
It provides very distant radar contacts.
Disadvantage

There is no range information. Normal search is not available while using
VS. There is no detection of targets without a positive TRGS.

Limitation
The system requires at least 80 knots of positive TRGS before it displays
any targets on the radar scope. The steering dot and circle provide pure

pursuit steering.

Vector Scan (VCTR) Mode

The fourth LRS mode, vector scan, is an all-HPRF RWS that changes to a
slower antenna scan rate. It is mechanized for small RCS target
detection, but will normally give longer range contacts than HI on any size
target.

Advantage

The main advantage of vector scan is longer range pickups.

Disadvantage

Vector scan has poor beam and tail-on acquisitions, and due to its slow
scan rate, takes a much longer time to search a volume of airspace.

Limitation

FM ranging is a limitation. Also, due to the slow scan rate, target
Maneuvering may go undetected or create false targets.

Text from RDR-2_APG-70_Introduction_page_47.jpeg:
Highlight Mode

A special highlight mode can be entered from search with the MRM
selected, which provides track-like data for a target in search. To enter,
bracket target with acquisition symbol and select quickstep (front cockpit
coolie switch up for less than 1 second/rear cockpit castle switch depress
for less than 1 second).

NOTE

Highlight provides track-like information and symbology; however
the radar mode remains search. Launch of a missile from this mode

will result in a flood AIM-7 or visual AIM-120 shot.

When a target is highlighted, the radar enters a series of mini-rasters
about the selected target. Once vector status is achieved on the target,
mini-raster is exited. The radar then returns to the search bar, which was
interrupted for the highlight and completes the current scan.

Upon entry into the highlight mode, the acquisition symbol will stay
latched to the highlighted target until moved to another location. The
acquisition symbol will relatch if placed back over the highlighted target.

A 3/4 intensity diamond is placed over the highlighted target on the
display. The diamond receives a long heading vector if vector status is
achieved (sufficient hits to determine heading information). While the
highlighted target is identified, target data (true airspeed, aspect angle,
and mag heading) is displayed at the top left of the A/A radar display.
The highlighted target's altitude is displayed as a digital readout on the
left side of the display, and a range caret and Vc (combined overtake) are
displayed on the right side of the display. Target altitude, aspect angle,
the range caret (with Vc) and the TD box are displayed on the HUD
(Figure D-29). The weapon steering dot and weapon employment cue are
displayed on the HUD and radar display; the ASE circle and break X are
not displayed.

Periodic Doppler Mode

Although the INS is the main source of the radar's velocity data, the
aircrew should be aware that HPRF search modes will periodically enter a
doppler update mode. During this update, doppler GS updates the radar's
velocity data and positions the radar's main lobe clutter (MLC) filters.
There is no effect on GS or INS present position data. The update
requires approximately 3 seconds to complete. During the update, as the
display freezes, the aircrew will notice the azimuth and elevation carets
move to 0°. During the 3-second period, the antenna drives down 15°
below the INS horizon and alternately left or right 45°.

The doppler update is fully automatic and occurs approximately every
7 minutes. The only aircrew action that can prevent the update is to
operate in an all medium PRF. The update mode is automatically
inhibited in TWS and during the presence of jamming (AOJ). If the
seven-minute timer expires during STT or HOJ extrapolate, the
three-second update occurs 32 seconds after RTS.

F-15E RADAR INTRODUCTION
Description

The F-15E radar is a high frequency, pulse doppler, attack radar. Its
design is optimized for both air-to-ground and air-to-air combat. In the
air-to-air mode, the radar provides target range, range rate and angular
rates to the CC for attack computations. The CC digitally produces and
displays radar targets on the MPD based on radar information. Radar
controls are available on the MPD/MPCD and HOTAS. The radar
operates with utility A hydraulics and main generator power.

Multifrequency

The F-15E radar is a multifrequency radar. The capability exists to
spread the operating frequency across a wide band of the electromagnetic
spectrum. This reduces mutual interference and enhances jamming
avoidance. The radar's band is selectable on the MPD/MPCD with PB #20
(Figure D-1). The channel is selectable with PB #19. The combination of
band/channel selection determines the radar operating frequency in
search.

D-1 RDR-2


Text from RDR-2_APG-70_Introduction_page_8.jpeg:
Interference

Mutual radar interference is likely with F-15E radars operating on the
same frequency (Figure D-1). To prevent mutual interference (MI), widely
separated bands and channels will be assigned during the premission
brief.

AIM-7 problems due to mutual interference are a potential problem within
an individual flight. Ifthe flight's frequencies are too close together, one
radar can degrade the AIM-7 performance of another. You can reduce
potential problems by selecting radar channels as widely separated as
possible.

Multi PRF

The APG-70 uses different PRFs to perform its various functions. Specific
aspects and ranging functions have their own assigned PREF.

Aspect

High PRF (HPRF) provides the high aspect, nose-on capability of doppler
radar. Medium PRF (MPRF) improves the all-aspect capability.

RDR-2 D-2


Text from RDR-2_APG-70_Introduction_page_9.jpeg:
Ranging

High PRF ranging in radar search is done in accordance with the FM
ranging process discussed in the RDR-2 lesson. Medium PRF ranging is
done by the pulse method of timing. The radar uses multiple PRFs to
reach an accord on the exact range before displaying the target.

Search

In addition to HPRF or MPRF search, the F-15E is capable of a
combination PRF search. This interleaved PRF uses both high and
medium PRF waveforms. Multiple PRF search improves the all-aspect
detection capability, but at a price. Often the same target appears at
different ranges on the display (range ambiguity). This is due to the type
of PRF (high or medium) at the time of acquisition.

Phase Comparison Monopulse

The F-15E radar is a phase comparison monopulse tracker (Figure D-2).
It is very similar to the monopulse radar discussed previously. The sine
wave phase comparison of the reflected energy determines azimuth and
elevation errors.

SUM OF 1 AND 3 COMPARED TO SUM OF 2 AND 4 = AZIMUTH ERROR

SUM OF 1 AND 2 COMPARED TO SUM OF 3 AND 4 = ELEVATION ERROR
