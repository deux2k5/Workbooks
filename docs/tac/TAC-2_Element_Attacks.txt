The time the previous aircraft’s weapon frag is in the air can be found in
the Maximum Bomb/Rocket Fragment Travel Chart in TO 1-1M-34. This
gives the maximum time any generic piece of frag should be airborne.
Using the maximum bomb fragment travel chart, the time of flight of frag
for all types of MK-82s at 5000 feet TDA is 25.9 seconds (Figure D-3).

The time required for a ripple release is computed using the formula

(N - 1) X INT, where N is the total number of weapon release pulses
(number of weapons for ripple single releases, number of weapons divided
by how many stations to be released from for ripple multiple releases) in
the string of bombs, and INT is the interval (in seconds) between releases.
INT can be found (listed as Ripple Interval) in the CWDS printout
(Figure D-4), or the impact spacing factor tables in TO 1-1M-34. Using a
ripple single delivery with 28 foot impact spacing the ripple release time is
0.33 seconds (11 X 30 msec).

Thus, the total time deconfliction required for frag deconfliction is
computed by adding these times (6.46 + 25.9 + .33), resulting in the total
time of 32.69 seconds. In other words, 32.69 seconds is the minimum
required spacing between aircraft to ensure #2 has time deconfliction from
the lead aircraft’s frag pattern.

D-5 TAC-2


Text from TAC-2_Element_Attacks_page_12.jpeg:
Advantages / Disadvantages

Deconflicting by time allows aircraft in the element to overfly the same
target at lower altitudes. However, spacing by time may degrade mutual
support because the time delay between deliveries allows the enemy to
prepare for subsequent attackers. For this reason, predictability should
be reduced by attacking from different axes whenever possible.

Altitude Deconfliction

To avoid the fragmentation pattern using altitude separation, following
aircraft must stay above the maximum altitude of the fragment envelope
of the preceding aircraft’s munitions. Using the same example,

Figure D-3 shows that 2500 feet is the minimum altitude in order to stay
above the frag for a MK-82 delivery on a target with a TDA of 5000 feet.

For a diving delivery, the following aircraft cannot descend below the top
of the frag envelope. Therefore, altitude lost during the ripple release
(found in TO 1-1M-34 or the CWDS program) plus the altitude lost during
pullout (from the CWDS program) must be added to the maximum
altitude for the fragment envelope to compute a minimum release altitude
(MRA). For example, let us compute the altitude deconfliction required for
a wingman to stay above the frag if the flight lead drops MK-82 low drag
general purpose (LDGP) bombs on a target and the wingman needs to
stay above lead’s frag as he drops 12 MK-82 LDGP bombs from a 20°
diving delivery at 500 KTAS on a target with a density altitude of 5000
feet, then executes a 5 G climbing safe escape maneuver. First, the frag
altitude for lead’s bombs can be found in the Maximum Bomb Fragment
Travel chart (Figure D-3). This chart shows the altitude of the frag to be
2500 feet. To this, we must add the altitude lost during ripple release of
285 feet from the CWDS printout in Figure D-5. In addition, we must add
the altitude lost during dive recovery value of 730 feet from the CWDS
printout in Figure D-6. By adding these values (2500 + 285 + 730), we
find that the wingman must release his bombs no lower than 3515 feet
AGL. Thus, a MRA of 3515 feet AGL allows the wingman to release all 12
bombs with the planned release interval and recover from the 20° dive
while staying above lead’s frag.

TAC-2 D-6


Text from TAC-2_Element_Attacks_page_13.jpeg:
A much easier way to do this is to use the “min recovery/release” option on
the delivery page of CWDS. In the example above, you would input 2500'
(or pad it) as the “min recovery/release” altitude and CWDS will calculate
your release altitude. The altitude lost during ripple release and dive
recovery are included in the CWDS computed release altitude. In order to
provide for a safe margin of error, the MRA is usually calculated for 5°
steeper than planned dive angle. For a planned 20° delivery, the MRA
calculations and dive recovery numbers would be based on flying a 25°
dive. This provides a reasonable margin of error for being off planned

parameters.

Text from TAC-2_Element_Attacks_page_14.jpeg:
Advantages / Disadvantages

Using altitude as the only means of deconfliction allows aircraft in the
element to attack a target immediately after the preceding aircraft.
However, the increased altitude may increase exposure time and place the
trailing aircraft in the lethal envelope of additional enemy defense
systems as he maneuvers for the weapons delivery.

Horizontal Deconfliction

To avoid the fragmentation pattern using horizontal separation, trailing
aircraft must remain outside the maximum horizontal range of the
fragment envelope for the preceding attacker’s munitions. Figure D-3
shows that 2900 feet is the minimum separation required for a MK-82
delivery on a target with a TDA of 5000 feet. Horizontal spacing assumes
parallel flight paths. For converging attack axes, the trailing aircraft
must remain outside the horizontal frag pattern of lead’s bombs in all
directions.

Another consideration when releasing weapons from the outer CFT
stations is the F-15E CFT lateral displacement (how far the bomb is
ejected sideways from the outer CFT bomb racks). This is listed on the
CWDS printout (Figure D-9, page D-11). You should add this value to the
horizontal range of the frag from the Dash 34 chart. It is usually a small
value that is fairly insignificant, but is a good reason to “pad” the
deconfliction required by rounding up the value (if it is not directly
known). This only applies when bombs are ejected from the outer CFT
racks due to their angle and cant away from the jet.

Computing the horizontal deconfliction for cluster bomb units (CBUs) is
slightly different (Figure D-7). The horizontal separation must be equal to
or greater than the larger of the following:

e Maximum horizontal range of the fragment envelope for an
intact cluster.

e Sum of the CBU pattern half-width plus the maximum

horizontal range of the fragment envelope for the submunition
as shown in Figure D-7.

Advantages / Disadvantages

Using lateral spacing for deconfliction allows aircraft in the element to
attack two targets simultaneously. This type of spacing is most commonly
used against area targets or targets with different designated mean points
of impact (DMPIs). When attacking one target/DMPI, horizontal spacing
can be taken in the form of standoff deliveries such as loft or low altitude
toss (LAT) allowing simultaneous attacks.

Text from TAC-2_Element_Attacks_page_18.jpeg:
Fingertip Formation

If time, altitude, or horizontal deconfliction cannot be achieved during
simultaneous formation deliveries on the same target/DMPI, then the
wingman must be in close (fingertip) formation. In this type of delivery,
fragment protection is provided by the safe escape minimum release
altitude.

WARNING

The wingman must not drop back to
any type of route or trail position
during formation deliveries; doing so
will significantly increase the
probability of fragmentation.

There is very little utility in this type of delivery since it requires a target
with no significant threats and ROE liberal enough to allow a fairly
inaccurate delivery.

Deconfliction Summary

Fragmentation deconfliction has become easier in recent years by more
effectively taking advantage of standoff capability, often made possible by
the use of precision guided weapons and/or the increased accuracy of
aircraft systems.

In summary, each type of deconfliction has advantages and
disadvantages. However, on most occasions a combination of deconfliction
types is used. This is particularly true in a large composite strike force
where overflying the target is required. Further, when employing a
precision guided (smart) weapon, deconfliction is easily achieved through
loft/LAT/medium altitude delivery profiles.

TAC-2 D-12


Text from TAC-2_Element_Attacks_page_19.jpeg:
ATTACK PROFILES

Element attacks are normally done with two to four aircraft which are
part of a larger composite strike force. However, the focus of this section
is on the basic fighting unit (two-ship) element attacks. Element attacks
fall into one of three profiles: the split, echelon, and trail attacks. These
attack profiles can be performed as either sequential or simultaneous
attacks.

Split Attack

The split attack option is designed for minimum exposure while splitting
the defenses. Sequential split attacks are achieved through time spacing.
However, other types of deconfliction can be used.

For time deconfliction, the second aircraft achieves separation by
traversing a greater distance over the ground. For example, at a
predetermined action point one aircraft turns either across or away from
the other element member and away from the target. After the planned
spacing is achieved, the aircraft turns back toward the target

(Figure D-10). This allows both aircraft to ingress, deliver their weapons,
and egress at lower altitudes.

Text from TAC-2_Element_Attacks_page_20.jpeg:
Against an area target, lateral separation enables you to accomplish a
simultaneous split attack. The attack sequence from the split point to the
egress point must be separated either laterally or vertically when used
against single DMPIs. Frag deconfliction can be obtained through
altitude (single DMPI) or by horizontally deconflicting the frag envelope
for separate DMPIs as shown in Figure D-11.

TAC-02-11

Figure D - 11. Simultaneous Split Attack.
Some advantages of the split attack are:

e It provides minimum exposure time in the target area.

e It splits the defenses and complicates their targeting plan.
Some disadvantages of the split attack are:

e Once the split occurs visual mutual support may be degraded.

e  Ifone fighter is engaged the other may not be able to bring
ordnance to bear on the attacker until after weapon release.

TAC-2 D-14


Text from TAC-2_Element_Attacks_page_21.jpeg:
e Because of crossing angles, regaining mutual support when
egressing might be more difficult.

e If timing deconfliction is used, the first attack will alert the
defenses to follow-on attacks.

Echelon Attack

An echelon attack option is designed for maximizing mutual support and
the number of aircraft across the target in the least amount of time
(Figure D-12). For example, at a predetermined point, both aircraft turn
away from the target for angle-off pops. When lead turns back toward the
target, two follows. If a sequential echelon attack is desired, then the
tactical separation is maintained. If a simultaneous echelon attack is
desired, then the tactical separation is decreased. When lead turns back
toward the target, two can turn to the same target/DMPI, or to another
target/DMPI. If lateral separation is inadequate for frag clearance, then
the following aircraft can recover at a higher altitude than the lead
aircraft’s fragmentation, or use a standoff delivery to remain outside the
frag envelope.

TAC-02-12

Figure D - 12. Echelon Attack.

D-15 TAC-2


Text from TAC-2_Element_Attacks_page_22.jpeg:
A simultaneous loft is one form of an echelon attack. Here, both aircraft
maintain tactical formation with the wingman slightly aft of line abreast
(approximately 15-30° aft) until approximately 10 seconds TPULL. The
wingman then turns to center the attack steering and executes the loft
delivery simultaneously with, or just behind, his leader. In this situation,
it is important that #2 does not get ahead of his leader or pull off in such a
way as to cross the flight path of lead’s ordnance. Also, the recovery
should be planned away from the wingman so lead will not have a
deconfliction problem with the wingman’s ordnance. Plan and fly the
recovery to ensure aircraft and munition deconfliction, to include the other
aircraft’s munitions if performing simultaneous deliveries.

Some advantages of echelon attacks are:
e Good visual support throughout the attack with good 6 o’clock
coverage for lead. However, the wingman’s 6 o’clock coverage is

degraded.

e  Itis easier for the wingman, since he flies visual formation off
lead which reduces his navigation requirements.

e The proximity of the two aircraft to each other decreases their
time in the target area and simplifies the egress geometry.

Some disadvantages of echelon attacks are:

e The proximity of the aircraft in the element makes it easier for
the enemy defenses to locate and engage both aircraft.

e AAAor SAM aimed at one aircraft may hit the other aircraft.

TAC-2 D-16


Text from TAC-2_Element_Attacks_page_23.jpeg:
Trail Attack

The trail attack option may be useful when it is necessary to have both
aircraft overfly the target on the same axis with time deconfliction. This
may be driven by weather, terrain, target type, threat, or ordnance being
delivered. There are many ways of attaining this trail interval. One way
is for the following aircraft to execute an x number of degrees turn away
from lead and hold that heading for a preplanned number of seconds.
After the time has expired the following aircraft reverses back to course,
falling into trail. The delay prior to the reverse is driven by the desired
trail interval. Figure D-13 is an example of deploying to trail for
sequential level deliveries.

TAC-2


Text from TAC-2_Element_Attacks_page_24.jpeg:
Some advantages of the trail attack are:

Each aircraft’s maneuverability is maximized.

It provides an excellent SAM lookout as the second aircraft can
stay low and check for SAMs while the first aircraft is over the
target area.

On a hard-to-find target, the leader may be able to direct the
wingman’s eyes to the target or give a correction off his bombs.

Some disadvantages of the trail attack are:

TAC-2

It provides no visual mutual support for the second aircraft
during most of the attack.

The attacking aircraft may be in the target area for an extended
period of time, allowing gunners a longer time to acquire and
target the trailing aircraft. Attacking from the same axis also
makes acquisition of the trailing aircraft easier.

The lead aircraft’s bomb alerts the defenses increasing the
threats in the target area for the trailers.

SOLVING FOR DECONFLICTION

GIVEN: Number of aircraft - 2 F-15Es
Munitions - 4 MK-84 AITRs, FMU-139 4 sec arm
Delivery - level, 550 KTAS, 500 feet AGL, 100 msec spacing,
ripple multiple
2500 target density altitude (TDA)

Time Deconfliction

As mentioned earlier, time spacing required between two aircraft is based
upon the delivery TOF, the time required for a ripple release, and how
long the previous aircraft’s weapon frag is in the air. The amount of
separation, in a trail attack for example, must be equal to or greater than
the added values.

For this example, a level delivery of 4 MK-84 AIR (HD) at 550 KTAS and
500 feet AGL has a TOF of 5.89 seconds (Figure D-14). With an impact

spacing of 100 msec, the ripple release time is 0.10 seconds (100 msec X 1).

The 1 in this equation results from (N - 1) where N is the number of
release pulses (2 for ripple multiple of 4 weapons).

ELEMENT ATTACKS
Introduction

There are several reasons for accomplishing an element attack. One is to
provide mutual support against enemy defenses such as SAMs, AAA, and
Als. Second, element attacks allow compressed TOTs which reduce time
spent in the target area and/or near the threat. Third, maneuvering
elements employing various countermeasures complicate or disrupt the
enemy’s targeting plan, thereby delaying or denying engagement.
Element attacks enhance survivability; however, fragmentation
deconfliction must be planned.

FRAG DECONFLICTION

For a single aircraft attacking a target, frag deconfliction is provided by
the safe escape/separation planning charts and tables located in

TO 1-1M-34 and the tables option in CWDS planning software for specific
weapons and release conditions. Flying the depicted safe escape
maneuver provides protection for a one-in-a-thousand chance of being
struck by your own frag when releasing at the minimum release altitude.
When attacking as elements (and target overflight is required) the trailing
aircraft must be concerned not only with his own frag, but also with the
leading aircraft’s frag. Therefore, plan the attack so trailing aircraft avoid
the frag pattern for the required time, altitude, and/or horizontal distance.

Figure D-1 depicts the frag pattern of a MK-82 general purpose (GP)
bomb. Given a target density altitude (TDA) of 5000 feet, the frag pattern
for a MK-82 remains a factor for 25.9 seconds, with a height of 2500 feet
and a 2900 foot radius. This information comes from the Maximum
Bomb/Rocket Fragment Travel Chart found in TO 1-1M-34, Chapter 6, a
portion of which is depicted in Figure D-3 on page D-4. The chart provides
information for both sea level and 5000 foot density altitudes (DAs).
Values may be interpolated or extrapolated to 10,000 foot DAs. The frag
pattern can be visualized as a cylinder and must be considered full of frag
for the entire frag time of flight (taken from the Dash 34 chart or CWDS
program) to ensure deconfliction.

Time Deconfliction

Time spacing required between two aircraft is based upon the delivery
time of fall (TOF) and how long the previous aircraft’s weapon frag is in
the air. The amount of separation must be equal to or greater than the
added values. In addition, if a ripple release is used, the time required for
all of the weapons to be released from the aircraft must be included.

Delivery TOF is listed on the CWDS computer program printout as “TIME
OF FALL FIRST RELEASE” (Figure D-4, page D-5), or on the ballistic
tables produced by the CWDS program (Figure D-2). For example, 12
MK-82 Air High Drags dropped on a level delivery at 550 KTAS and 500
feet AGL, on a target with a density altitude of 5000 feet, have a TOF of
6.46 seconds.
