NAV FLIR CONTROLS AND FUNCTIONS

The LANTIRN system is made up of two pods: the AN/AAQ-13 navigation
pod and the AN/AAQ-14 targeting pod. The navigation pod, located below
the right intake, contains the NAV FLIR (upper section) and the terrain
following (TF) radar (lower section, Figure D-3). The targeting pod,
located below the left intake, contains the targeting IR and laser
designator. The remainder of this lesson is about the upper section of the
AN/AAQ-13 navigation pod (NAV FLIR).

Text from LAN-2_NAV_FLIR_page_15.jpeg:
AN/AAQ-13 Navigation Pod

The NAV FLIR, also known as the FINS (forward imaging navigation set),
is housed in the pylon section of the pod, above the TFR (Figure D-4). The
forward section assembly is made up of the optical and electronic
equipment needed to detect the terrain along the flight path as an
infrared image. It subsequently transforms the image into a video signal
for the HUD. The upper section also contains the pod power supply and a
center section containing a maintenance panel and environmental control
unit (ECU) controller. The lower section contains the TFR system and the
ECU, which supplies all cooling for the NAV pod.

Text from LAN-2_NAV_FLIR_page_16.jpeg:
Purpose of NAV FLIR

In support of TF operations, the NAV FLIR provides the aircrew with a
limited type of night vision. A FLIR video of real world terrain in front of
the aircraft enhances situational awareness and low altitude maneuvering
capabilities. The system is passive and enemy defenses cannot detect its
use.

The NAV FLIR generates a 21° by 28° (HUD size) black and white image
of terrain ahead of the aircraft. The HUD size contains 480 lines of video;
however, the NAV FLIR produces only 360 lines of video. Therefore, one
line of video is artificially produced for each line of NAV FLIR video in
order to fill the HUD display. It is presented to the pilot in the HUD asa
1:1 correspondence with the real world. This means the IR images should
be exactly superimposed over the real scene. Objects appear in the same
relative size and position as they do in the HUD with the NAV FLIR off,
allowing terrain avoidance, target acquisition and visual weapons
delivery. When the NAV FLIR scene (IR image) is not exactly
superimposed over the real scene, an electrical boresight correction
(discussed later) will be used to correct the condition. Even though the
scene is 1:1, there is no true depth perception. The image presented to the
crew is a TV-like picture requiring the use of TFR to fly low level.

LAN-2 D-10


Text from LAN-2_NAV_FLIR_page_17.jpeg:
NAV FLIR Functional Description

The Risley snap look assembly contains two prisms controlled by
servomotors, which enable the crew to check terrain features. An afocal
lens then receives the IR image and relays it to the scanner assembly.
The IR image is then read by the scanner assembly and routed and turned
by the IR imager to the focus wedge. The received IR image is then
focused on the detector/cooler assembly, which is kept at -186°C to
increase the detector’s sensitivity. It is comprised of a vertical array of
180 photoconductive diodes that produce a small electrical signal when
struck by IR energy. This analog data is passed through the digital scan
converter, which amplifies and converts the information into a digital
representation of the IR scene, which is then converted to composite IR
video for display on the HUD (Figure D-5).

NAV FLIR Operations

Applying Power

The pod is controlled via the sensor control panel (Figure D-6). Placing
the NAV FLIR to STBY powers up the FLIR and initiates the required
5 to 8 minute cool-down period, but may take less than 5 minutes or as
long as 14 minutes, depending on the conditions.

Figure D - 6. Sensor Control Panel.

If either the NAV FLIR or the TF RDR switch is out of OFF, power is
supplied to the NAV pod. To shut the pod down, both switches must be
OFF. Power should be removed from the pod prior to shutting down an
engine, cycling a generator or doing anything else that could cause a
power interruption or pressure surge, as this will trip circuit breakers
and/or blow seals in the pod itself, requiring maintenance action. Also,
whenever power is removed from the pod, allow 1 minute in OFF prior to
turning the system back on to avoid tripping the breakers.

HUD Controls

HUD Brightness: The HUD is turned on, and symbology brightness is
controlled by the BRT knob (Figure D-9). Turning the knob clockwise
increases the symbology intensity. The video imagery is not affected.

Day, Auto, Night Switch: Depending on ambient light conditions, select
DAY, AUTO or NIGHT on the HUD Control Panel. DAY applies
maximum intensity control range to all brightness controls. AUTO
enables the HUD to maintain consistent symbol brightness for adequate
illumination at night. NIGHT reduces video and symbology brightness
approximately 98% lower than the “DAY” intensity.

Video Brightness (VID BRT): This knob permits one-step adjustment of
the HUD at night. The knob adjusts the intensity of both the video
imagery and the symbology.

Video Contrast (VID CONT): This knob must be turned on to view the IR
video imagery and to adjust the shades of gray on the HUD.

Manual, NAV FLIR Tuning - After selecting MAN-GAIN/LEVEL and
GRAY SCALE on the NAV FLIR submenu, you will have up to 13 shades
of gray displayed. Manually set the LEVEL and GAIN knobs on the
sensor control panel at 12 o'clock. Adjust the LEVEL knob so that the
brightness of the center block of the gray scale matches the desired
average brightness of the IR scene. Adjust the GAIN knob to saturate
man-made objects, and then reduce the GAIN slightly. Deselect GRAY
SCALE after tuning is complete.

NOTE

During day operations, you will only see a maximum of 6 to 7 shades

of gray due to color blending in high light conditions.

White Hot and Black Hot

W-HOT or B-HOT are alternately selected by cycling PB #4 on the NAV
FLIR submenu (Figure D-11, left). White hot is the video display in which
hot areas appear as light green and cold areas appear as black. Black hot
is a reversed polarity display, showing hot areas as black, cold areas as
green. The choice of using black hot or white hot is the pilot’s personal
preference.

Mechanical Boresight

During NAV FLIR preflight checks, the mechanical boresight values
should be verified. This is accomplished by selecting boresight (BRST), PB
#9, on the NAV FLIR submenu (Figure D-11, left). This can be done
during the cool-down period. The boresight submenu (Figure D-11, right)
displays the yaw, pitch and roll mechanical boresight values (in
milliradians, mils). These values are unique to each aircraft because of
manufacturing tolerance errors of the pod/aircraft hard point mounting
pads, and are stored in the CC. If the displayed values do not match the
781 values, correct values can be input using the UFC scratchpad and PBs
#2, #3 and #4.

Electrical Boresight

If the NAV FLIR image (azimuth and elevation) is not coincident with the
real world through the HUD, the pilot can electrically slew the FLIR
sensor to the correct boresight using the TDC. Use an object that is in the
approximate center of the HUD display, and visible to the naked eye and
to the NAV FLIR. The object should be a minimum of 2 miles from the
aircraft to increase the accuracy of the boresight and reduce any paralax
errors. First, select the BRST mode (PB #9) on the NAV FLIR submenu,
and then select ELEC (PB #7). N-F BRST appears in the HUD to indicate
the mode. Second, select NAV Master Mode. Third, take command of the
HUD and slew the NAV FLIR seeker in AZ and EL with the TDC (Figure
D-12) to superimpose the IR image on the real world as closely as possible.
To avoid canceling inputs, select DATA or MENU on the UFC to exit the
boresight mode. In flight, if the line of sight gets out of tolerance more
than 13 mils, the caution N-F LOS appears in the HUD when the NAV
FLIR image is showing. When this occurs, the NAV FLIR cannot be relied
on for precise navigation.

The aircrew cannot trust NAV

Look-Into-Turn

Look-into-turn (LIT) has two methods of operation; manual is commanded
by the coolie switch on the right throttle and automatic is selected through
the UFC. Once activated, LIT provides a 6°, horizon stabilized,
look-into-turn on the HUD. Manual LIT is activated by pushing down and
holding the coolie switch in the FCP and exceeding 5° bank (Figure D-138).
LIT is commanded until the switch is released, or bank angle decreases to

NAV FLIR CAPABILITIES AND LIMITATIONS
Physical Limitations

The NAV FLIR has certain physical and operational limitations. These
include:

NAV FLIR field of regard 78° (H) X 39° (W)
HUD field of view 21° (H) X 28° (W)
Center of NAV FLIR XT = 0° Az and -4.5° El from a line

parallel to the aircraft water line.
IR wavelength 8-12 microns
Minimum detectable Delta T Better than 0.15° C
Blind Spot

Because the NAV pod is mounted under the right side of the fuselage, left
LIT and snap look have a blind area in some aircraft attitudes. This blind
spot is caused by the fuselage (and ordnance if loaded) entering the FLIR
field of view as the aircraft is rolled left.

Synchronization

If the NAV FLIR video does not coincide with the real world, there is no
aircrew notification of this error until it exceeds 13 mils, resulting in the
NF LOS caution. Periodically crosscheck NAV FLIR imagery against
terrain seen visually or indicated by the TF/air-to-ground radar. If in
doubt of the synchronization, climb to a safe altitude before investigating.
If necessary, electrically boresight the system using a distant point that is
visible both to the eye and the NAV FLIR.

Text from LAN-2_NAV_FLIR_page_33.jpeg:
Bland Video
There are several possible reasons for bland video.
e Rain, snow or clouds scattering or washing out the IR energy.

e The detector cooler assembly malfunctioning, heating the detector
and thus degrading the video.

e The nose of the aircraft pointed above the horizon into a cloudless
sky.

e A poorly adjusted HUD/NAV FLIR video.

The horizon virtually disappears in wings level flight with a distant, flat
horizon. Banking 2-5° and rolling out can restore the horizon
momentarily.

Target/NAV Points

NAV FLIR night employment experience shows that certain turn
points/targets are better than others for navigational purposes.
Generally, points suitable for day visual navigation are also suitable for
night using the NAV FLIR. Good NAV FLIR navigation features include
portions of small and distinct lakes, land-water contrast, mountain peaks
and industrial complexes. Features that do not make good IR navigation
points include indistinct or similar peaks, bridges, road/railroad
intersections, river bends in forested areas and lines of communication

(LOC).
Lakes

Small lakes (less than 1 nm across) have a high Delta T on calm nights,
but are not observable until close (1 to 2 nm range at 200 feet AGL). They
make good turn points if LOS is not obstructed. Medium lakes (1 to 3 nm
across) show good thermal contrast, and are seen from 1 to 3 nm range at
200 feet AGL. The best turn points are small distinct parts of a lake or
tips of land. Large lakes can be seen at even greater distances.


Text from LAN-2_NAV_FLIR_page_34.jpeg:
Land Water Contrast

Prominent points of land make excellent navigation points. These include
peninsulas on large bodies of water, islands in large lakes and points on
coastlines. Acquisition ranges from 1 to 4 nm at 200 feet AGL.

Peaks
Isolated peaks show a high thermal contrast against the cold sky
background. On the average, isolated peaks without towers are visually

identified at 5 nm, some as far as 12 nm at 200 feet AGL.

Industrial Complexes

Industrial complexes make excellent navigation points and targets. The
burners, smokestacks, generators and other objects with high thermal
activity are particularly easy to identify. These targets are identified at
8 nm ranges. The average is 5 nm at 200 feet AGL.

Lines Of Communication (LOC)

LOCs such as bridges, road intersections, road/railroad intersections and
railroad junctions do not make good IR navigation points. LOCs are
significantly affected by atmospheric conditions. Attack axis is critical in
identifying LOCs. Flying parallel to the LOC provides the best
opportunity to identify the LOC, though this is not a good tactical choice.
Optimizing line-of-sight and attack axis leads to average acquisition
ranges, at 200 feet AGL, of only 1 nm.

IR Rules of Thumb

Maximum FLIR acquisition ranges occur in dry, clear air. Dirty, moist air
means degraded or minimum pickup ranges. High absolute humidity (i.e.,
high dew point) absorbs IR radiation, reducing the effectiveness of the
FLIR.

Falling precipitation (rain, drizzle, snow or dense fog) reduces the Delta T
significantly. Falling rain appears as large, hot, out-of-focus spots or
vertical lines in the video. Over water flying can also degrade the IR
imagery (i.e., a moisture band can extend up to 500 feet).

LAN-2 D - 28


Text from LAN-2_NAV_FLIR_page_35.jpeg:
Falling snow appears as a gradual blanding of the video, until no image
remains. Snow on the ground tends to reduce background clutter, and
highlights structures and trees.

Wet ground reduces thermal clutter, but also reduces thermal contrast,
resulting in bland video. Lakes make excellent turnpoints except in
swampy areas where the water and land are almost the same
temperature. Dry ground increases thermal clutter, but normally
provides better contrast between objects and background.

Clear skies increase the Delta T, increase the potential of thermal clutter
and provide sharper diurnal crossovers. Diurnal crossovers occur near
sunrise and sunset and occur more slowly under overcast skies. Overcast
skies reduce the Delta T, but make it easier to see self-heated targets.
Strong winds reduce Delta T.

Massive vertical objects are easy to see, because they are heated
differently than the background. Small or thin objects, such as power
lines or guide wires, are difficult to see.

Attacking with the sun at your back is still better than attacking into the
sun. Shortly after sunset, attacking from the southwest (in the northern
hemisphere) normally gives the best NAV FLIR video.

TEXT
INTRODUCTION

This lesson on the forward-looking infrared (FLIR) introduces the
navigation pod (AN/AAQ-13). It also addresses the tactical decision aid
(TDA) and pod operation and employment. Your ability to successfully
accomplish your mission will be enhanced by understanding how the NAV
FLIR and terrain following radar (TFR) can help get you to the target on
time. Together, these systems allow more consistent around-the-clock
navigational performance.

A reminder-—when using the NAV FLIR you are looking at a two
dimensional picture of the world, not the world itself. It is a replication, a
duplicate, a man-made image of the world, as though looking at a black
and white TV screen, but not the actual world. So, you must use caution
and correct procedures should you determine that the display does not
exactly mirror the real world. Be ready to quickly and correctly react to
an indication of system failure.

TACTICAL DECISION AID

Astute assessment of atmospherics is required for accurate predictions of
acquisition ranges and IR imagery. To support the different IR sensors in
the field, the Air Weather Service designed the tactical decision aid (TDA).
The TDA is a computer program that forecasts the expected thermal
contrast (Delta T), atmospheric transmission, and acquisition range of
targets and turn points. The product can be modified to suit local
commanders. Detection ranges are shown for the NAV and targeting
pods. The WFOV column is for the NAV FLIR and the TGT IR in wide
field of view. The NFOV column is for the TGT IR in narrow field of view.
A worksheet is prepared from forecasts, listing the above mentioned items
and additional comments that may be applicable to IR systems
employment, Figure D-1. The worksheet information is then used to
complete an electro-optics planning flimsy, Table D-1, page D-4.

A more qualitative description of IR conditions may be used in conjunction
with or to replace the current weather flimsy. For example:

Thermal Contrast Category (AT):
LOW = less than 2°C.

MEDIUM = 2°C to less than 5°C.
HIGH = 5°C and higher.

Polarity:
+ means target warmer than background.

- means target colder than background.

Atmospheric Transmissivity:

POOR .25 or less
FAIR .26 - .45
GOOD 46 - .64

VERY GOOD _ .65 or more

Each base's weather station can produce TDA formats that satisfy specific
requirements of the commanders and weapon systems they support
pursuant to Air Weather Service directives. An example of such a product
is shown in Table D-1, next page.
