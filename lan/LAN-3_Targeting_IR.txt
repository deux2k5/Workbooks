Level and Gain Knobs

These knobs are used to manually adjust the picture after the
MPD/MPCD display quality has been set. With automatic level and gain,
the target pod automatically adjusts its video gain/level to predetermined
settings. When using manual level and gain, for the best presentation,
tune the display first. With the gray scale selected, adjust the display
brightness so the darkest shade of gray appears black. Then adjust the
contrast so that all shades of gray are distinctly visible. After the display
is adjusted, set the level so that average scene brightness equals the
center shade on the gray scale. Next, increase gain until man-made
objects “bloom” or lose their sharpness, and then back off slightly.

Laser SAFE/ARM Switch

This two-position switch allows the laser to be fired from either cockpit
when it is in ARM and prevents laser fire when in SAFE. The laser status
is shown on the TGT IR display, on the HUD as a diamond around the
gun cross, and by the laser armed light in the FCP next to the right MPD.
The TGT IR power switch must be in the ON position to arm/fire the laser.

Display and HOTAS

As usual, most control functions can be done on the display itself.
Functions are also available on the HOTAS controls, some exclusively, as
shown in Figure D-4. You must be in command of the display to perform
most functions.

INITIALIZATION

The TGT IR presentation can be displayed on any MPD/MPCD. The only
difference is that the MPCD display is black and white instead of black
and green.

Power Off

With no power to the TGT IR the display looks like Figure D-5. Legends
will appear around the display; however, the pushbuttons will be
inoperative. TGT IR OFF-STOWED is displayed when the targeting pod
switch is set to OFF with the targeting pod stowed. TGT IR OFF-
UNSTOWED is displayed when the targeting pod switch is set to OFF
with the targeting pod unstowed. TGT IR OFF-“_” is displayed
whenever the CC is reset with aircraft weight on wheels and pod status is
unknown.

Targeting Pod Power-up

The operating status of the targeting pod is shown in the center of the
display. Placing the targeting pod power switch in STBY changes the
TGT IR OFF (STOWED, UNSTOWED, no text) status to TGT IR NRDY
(STOWED, UNSTOWED, no text) and starts the sensor head cooldown
period. This normally takes 5 to 8 minutes, but may take less than 5
minutes or as long as 15 minutes, depending on the conditions. TGT IR
NRDY is displayed for 5 to 8 minutes (average) while the targeting pod
cryogenic cooler achieves pod detector cooldown.

During cooldown, the targeting pod sensor head is stowed. In the stowed
position, the seeker is rotated 150° counterclockwise. When the cooldown
is complete, TGT IR STBY-STOWED or UNSTOWED is displayed

(Figure D-6). During targeting pod power up, the laser code, mechanical
boresight errors, operating mode, and other control functions are
displayed and selectable even though the video is not displayed. TGT IR
STBY-“ ” is displayed during first time power up when the targeting pod
switch is set to STBY from OFF, the aircraft is weight on wheels, and the
pod status is unknown.

targeting pod switch is placed to ON and the pod is stowed or is unstowing
(Figure D-7A). TGT IR OPER-UNSTOWED is displayed when the pod
switch is placed to ON and the pod is unstowed or when the pod becomes
unstowed (Figure D-7B). TGT IR OPERATE-UNSTOWED will be
displayed for 5 seconds after TGT IR VIDEO is displayed.

TARGETING POD SETUP

Once selected, the TGT IR display has two display options: primary (T1)
and setup (T2) in both the A/A and A/G modes. The desired display is
selected by pressing PB #13 (T1/T2). The T1 display (Figure D-8, left)
contains weapon employment data and should be the primary display for
normal targeting pod operations; otherwise, the displays are identical
except that the manual focus control, electrical boresight, and gray scale
options are not available on the T1 display. Initial targeting pod setup
(i.e., focus, boresighting, and tuning) functions are available on, and
performed from, the T2 display (Figure D-8, right).

Targeting Pod BIT

The targeting pod has two types of BITs: PBIT and IBIT. PBIT is
enabled when power is applied to the targeting pod and operates
continuously; it is noninterruptive and automatic. IBIT provides a
comprehensive system test and is performed (with the targeting pod
moded to STBY) via one of two methods:

e Selecting LANT/RALT from the main BIT page (thereby performing
IBIT on both LANTIRN subsystems and the radar altimeter).

e Selecting TGT POD to perform IBIT following selection of
LANT/RALT from the MAINT BIT page.

The first method is preferred since all LANTIRN subsystems can perform
IBIT with one selection. The initiated BIT for the pod takes about 70
seconds. The seeker uncages and looks straight ahead. Then all three
axes are checked; first yaw, then pitch, and last roll. Focus is also
checked. If the laser is placed to ARM prior to the test, the TGT IR will
automatically switch to the training (eye safe) laser and fire while the pod
is stowed during the test profile. This will ensure that the laser will fire
when unstowed. For the last ten seconds, a test pattern of alternating
vertical black and white lines appears. At test termination, the pod
returns to the STBY mode. TGT FLIR* will be displayed on the top level
BIT page, as shown in Figure D-9A, following completion of IBIT if a BIT
failure was detected. The asterisk next to TGT FLIR indicates that
DETAIL information may be available for this subsystem. The targeting
pod can report a maximum of 27 functional failures, 24 of which can be
displayed at one time on the DETAIL BIT page.

CAUTION

The IBIT should be run only when the
aircraft is stationary. While in motion,
an IBIT may cause servo system failure.

A second method of BIT is the individual target pod BIT. This method
BITs only the target pod which may be used to re-BIT the pod if a fault
has been detected in the target pod only or if a LANT/RALT BIT was
accomplished and the target pod was not timed in when the LANT/RALT
BIT was selected (Figure D-9).

TGT IR Tuning and Focus

Auto Level and Gain (ALG)/Manual Level and Gain (MLG) Selection

ALG or MLG may be selected on the T1 or T2 display by toggling PB #4
(Figure D-10). In ALG, ALG is boxed and the targeting pod automatically
adjusts its video gain/level to predetermined settings in the targeting pod.
In MLG, ALG is not boxed and the WSO can manually adjust the gain and
level of the targeting pod video using the gain and level controls on the
sensor control panel.

TGT IR Tuning

The targeting pod video contains a gray scale (Figure D-10) which replaces
the scene video at the bottom of the display upon command from PB #16
on the T2 display. The fixed gray scale occupies the bottom 60 active lines
with nine equally spaced shades of gray ranging from black to white. A
variable gray scale occupies 40 lines above the fixed scale and varies in
intensity based on input from the CONT/BRT controls on the MPD/MPCD

being used.

LAN-3 D-12


Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_19.jpeg:
Tuning the display with the target pod video on it before adjusting the
targeting pod gain/level provides the best presentation. The bottom fixed
scale is used to adjust the BRT control on the display so that the darkest
gray level appears black on the display. Then the CONT control on the
face of the display is adjusted until all of the shades of gray are distinctly
visible.

With MLG selected, the top variable gray scale varies as a function of the
IR scene and can be adjusted for optimum brightness and contrast using
the gain and level controls on the RCP sensor control panel. The TGT IR
video is tuned by adjusting the level until the middle gray is the desired
video shade and then adjusting the gain to achieve a slight saturation of
man-made objects. The gray scale should be used for reference only; it
does not indicate if the gain and level setting is correct for the scene.

Manual Focus Control

The manual focus buttons provide the capability to adjust the IR video
sharpness and clarity. The targeting pod automatically adjusts focus
based on lens temperatures; however, in the event that the focus appears
bad in one or more of the video FOVs, you can choose to adjust the focus
by pressing either PB #14 or PB #15 on the T2 display (Figure D-8, right)
until the image focus quality is satisfactory. The corresponding settings
displayed next to the pushbuttons can range in value from -50 to +50,
representing a total of approximately 0.4 inch of travel for the focus
adjustment lens. Separate focus adjustments are stored for wide FOV
(WFOV) and narrow FOV (NFOV); in expanded narrow FOV (ENFOV,
digital expansion of the NFOV video), the NFOV adjustment is used.
Focus settings can also be adjusted by typing in the appropriate focus
values in the UFC scratchpad and pressing either PB #14 or PB #15. The
targeting pod continues to compensate focus for temperature around the
new focus settings and the CC retains these settings until the aircraft is
shut down. A focus setting of zero represents the targeting pod automatic
focus position. At power-up, focus settings are initialized to zero.

Targeting Pod Boresighting

Targeting Pod Mechanical Boresight

Mechanical boresight errors (in mils) are displayed on the T2 display
(Figure D-11) to verify the proper pitch/roll/yaw constants. The
mechanical errors should remain constant until a new boresight is
accomplished or the CC is replaced or reprogrammed. These values
should agree with the values logged in the aircraft’s AFTO Form 781. The
values on the BRST display should be corrected (if required) to agree with
the AFTO Form 781 values. If the values in the AFTO Form 781 are in
hundredths of mils, they should be rounded up to the nearest tenth for
entry via the UFC. The correct mechanical error is entered on the UFC
scratchpad and the appropriate pushbutton (YAW: PB #1, PITCH:

PB #2, or ROLL: PB #3) is pressed while in command of the TGT IR T2
display.

If cueing the targeting pod (with bypass mode selected) yields errors
consistently in the same direction, and if bombing scores are in error in
the opposite direction (i.e., cue left, bombs fall to the right) when using the
targeting pod as the designation sensor, then mechanical boresight errors
should be suspect. Mechanical boresight errors may occur as a result of
incorrect entry of the error values, an alteration of boresight due to
OVER-G, or due to normal wear on the aircraft structure.

Figure D - 11. TGT IR Boressight (T2 Display).

Targeting Pod Electrical Boresight

The targeting pod is mechanically boresighted to assure proper alignment
with the pylon hard points. However, in order to effectively use the
targeting pod, it may be necessary for the aircrew to correct a bad
mechanical boresight or to use a targeting pod that is out of specification.
The aircrew is provided an option to manually correct the boresight
(electrical boresight). The INS must be in NAV to get an accurate
boresight.

Whenever the aircrew uses this electronic boresight correction to correct a
gross boresight misalignment, the targeting pod should be considered as
operating in a degraded mode. The targeting pod has an accuracy of
approximately 1.4 mils with a correct mechanical boresight, whereas the
electrical boresight of the targeting pod through the HUD is no better
than 2.5 mils.


Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_22.jpeg:
When in point track (PTRK), BRST is an option that becomes available
above PB #8 on the A/G TGT IR T2 display (Figure D-12). To minimize
parallax errors, PTRK must be initiated on a target that is in the HUD
FOV and at least 1 nm away from the aircraft. Ideally, this operation
should be performed in flight. After selecting BRST, the aircrew is
provided two additional options above PB #7 and PB #9 to either APPLY
or BYPASS the boresight correction, depending on how the pilot views the
boresight alignment through the HUD.

With BRST selected, the targeting pod LOS symbol is replaced by two
concentric circles (6.1 mils and 25.6 mils in diameter) centered over the
position the system calculates as the location of the object being point
tracked. Because of optical path errors, the real world object being
tracked will not be precisely centered inside the circles. To check the
mechanical boresight accuracy, first select BYPASS to clear out any
previous electrical corrections. The concentric circle location is affected by
the mechanical boresight errors entered on the T2 display. Only if the
point track object falls outside the inner circle should the aircrew consider
the option to apply electrical boresight corrections. Boresight errors are
corrected by selecting APPLY to enable electrical boresight corrections,
then, using the TDC while in command of the TGT IR display, slewing the
concentric circles in the HUD (the HUD repeater should never be used for
boresight operations) until they are centered over the point tracked target.
A boresight bias is calculated based on the TDC inputs used to center the
concentric circles. This boresight bias is used by the targeting pod
whenever APPLY is selected. (APPLD is displayed in the second row
above PB #8 on both the T1 and T2 displays.) The targeting pod then
applies these corrections until BYPASS is selected. BRST mode is exited
by deselecting BRST by pressing PB #8 or by commanding untrack.

The aircrew can manually select the desired FOV via the auto acq/mode
reject switch. The EXP option at PB #14 on the T1 display enables the
selection of ENFOV via HOTAS. When in command of the TGT IR display
and with EXP not boxed, pressing the auto acq/mode reject switch forward
for less than 1 second cycles between WFOV and NFOV. If EXP is boxed,
pressing the auto acq/mode reject switch forward cycles from WFOV to
NFOV (Figure D-14, left) to ENFOV (Figure D-14, right) to WFOV. If
EXP is unboxed while in the ENFOV, the targeting pod returns to NFOV.

Within the targeting pod video are four corner markers that outline what
will be seen if the next smaller FOV is commanded. Within the WFOV
display are four corner markers which outline the NFOV. With the NFOV
display are four corner markers which outline the ENFOV when EXP is
selected; if EXP is not selected, then the four corner markers are not
displayed. Within ENFOV no markers are shown. If the target is within
the corner markers, it is within the next smaller FOV.

LOS Position

Within the TGT IR display is a small open box (four small FOV corner
markers) which provides a rapid means to identify the approximate
azimuth and elevation of the targeting pod FLIR/laser LOS with respect
to the aircraft (Figure D-15). It is essentially a plan view of the sensor
position relative to the aircraft. The aircraft position is always in the
center of the display with the top of the display representing forward of
the aircraft.

Magnetic Heading/Direction Display

An indication of magnetic north is displayed on the targeting FLIR
air-to-ground displays (Figure D-16). This display is in relation to the
sensor line of sight, and can rotate as required to indicate magnetic north.

The magnetic north display is removed whenever declutter is selected.
Additionally, the display is removed if the INS and AHRS/EGI fails; or
sensor communications is invalid, in standby, or switched off.


Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_28.jpeg:
Declutter (DCL) Option

The DCL option (Figure D-13) is available (on T1 only) to allow the
aircrew to remove specific display items for all A/G and A/A, T1 and T2
displays. When DCL is selected, the following items are removed from the
A/G TGT IR display:

e =6BBR (bullseye, bearing, and range)

e@ Weapon launch zones and range scale

e Weapon status/delivery data

e Targeting pod LOS lat/long data

e Magnetic heading/direction display
Manual LOS Slave/Slew

The pod LOS may be changed manually in azimuth and/or elevation via
the TDC when in the A/G submodes of slave (cue) and track.

Slave Mode

If the pod is not commanded to TRACK, it defaults to the slave submode.
In this submode, the pod LOS is ground stabilized and points toward a
particular point or area on the ground. However, there can be a slight
amount of LOS drift in this submode. To manually slave the pod LOS, the
crew member in command uses the TDC to position the LOS in azimuth
and elevation. The TGT IR can also be slaved to a position by typing a
sequence point number into the scratchpad and entering it at PB #17, or
cueing the pod from the A/G RDR or TSD. To aid in positioning the pod
LOS, a sighting index (i.e., crosshairs) is displayed on the TGT IR.

Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_29.jpeg:
Track Mode

When you command TRACK (via HA on the trigger in the RCP or by auto
acq depression in the FCP), you are in the TRACK submode. To manually
change the pod LOS, the crew member in command uses the TDC to slew
the pod. Changing the pod LOS in the TRACK mode affects the
designation and is discussed in subsequent paragraphs. TRACK mode is
indicated with either ATRK or PTRK boxed at PB #10 (Figure D-16).

The direction and magnitude of slaving/slewing is indicated in the lower
left corner of the display. An arrow indicates the direction and a letter
indicates the rate (Figure D-16).

Tracking Submodes

Point Track (PTRK)

PTRK uses a point contrast video tracker that looks for IR contrast which
defines each edge/side of the target. Once an edge is found, the pod
defines this with vertical and horizontal lines in the center of the video.
PTRK is established when the target is bound with a rectangular box
centered on the display. The WHT or BHT selection at PB #5

(Figure D-17) determines what color man-made objects are to appear in
the IR scene (overall polarity). Either white or black targets may be point
tracked, depending on the target polarity tracking selection at PB #8
(Figure D-17), which will be discussed later.

The TGT IR displays two codes in the POINT TRACK MODE STATUS
WINDOW located in the lower left corner of the video display
(Figure D-17).

“P1” - The P1 cue informs the aircrew when the pod is able to track the
object in the video scene using PTRK as the selected contrast tracker.

“U1” - The U1 cue informs the aircrew when the pod is unable to track the
object in the video scene using PTRK as the selected contrast tracker.
Since it is displayed only for a brief instant when the point tracker
defaults to ATRK, it may not be seen by the aircrew.

Figure D - 17. Point Track Submode.

In the PTRK mode the targeting pod has the capability to polarity track
targets either in WHT or BHT video. The options available are WPT
(white polarity track), BPT (black polarity track), and APT (auto polarity
track). The system initializes to WPT, but is selectable either by toggling
PB #8 (Figure D-17) or by moving the RCP castle switch forward for less
than one second.

WPT commands the targeting pod to track white (green on color display)
targets within the tracking window. To enhance target contrast, all
embedded symbology is black.

BPT commands the targeting pod to track black targets within the
tracking window. To enhance target contrast, all embedded symbology is
conversely white.

APT commands the targeting pod to track either white or black targets,
depending on the color of the target at the center of the crosshairs when
PTRK is initiated. The targeting pod embedded symbology will be
opposite the color of the object being tracked. APT is only available as an
option in the A/G mode of the targeting pod.

Offset Track (OTRK)

When PTRK is boxed on the T1 display, the offset track submode becomes
available. OTRK can be selected (boxed) allowing you to attack a
non-IR-significant point. You must press PB #9 to box OTRK which
allows the cursor (crosshairs) to be separated from the track box. The pod
remains aimed at the IR-significant point as indicated by the track box,
but you can now move the cursor to another point (Figure D-18).

Once you designate the target under the cursor, steering is computed to
the target. You can move the cursor anywhere as long as the track box
remains in the FOV. Should you move it further, the pod reverts to area
track and ATRK appears above PB #10. This default also occurs if the
track box moves off the screen due to aircraft movement or if the pod loses
track. Ranging is to the point under the cursor. Pressing PB #9 again
returns you to PTRK.

Area Track (ATRK)

In this submode, a scene is tracked using an area correlation tracker. It
attempts to maintain this position based on a larger reference than is
used in PTRK. ATRK may be the best option for unbound targets such as
roads, railroads, bridges, etc. (Figure D-19). You can enter it anytime
from PTRK. Alternate depressions of PB #10 or depressing the RCP TDC
cycles between ATRK and PTRK.

The TARGET IR displays two codes in the AREA TRACK MODE STATUS
WINDOW, located in the lower left corner of the display.

“C” - TARGET CORRELATION TRACK CUE. The targeting pod is

tracking the object in the video scene using the target correlation tracker.

Point Track Default to Area Track (P/A)

If PTRK is commanded and the targeting pod is unable to acquire the
target, or PTRK is broken once established, the pod defaults to P/A, which
replaces PTRK at PB #10 (Figure D-20). This indicates the pod has
reverted to area track because the system is unable to acquire/maintain
point track. When the targeting pod is slewed with P/A displayed, it is
commanded to ATRK at the termination of the slew input, indicated at
PB #10.

Computed Rate Track (CMPT)

If PTRK or ATRK cannot be established or maintained, the pod defaults to
CMPT, as indicated at PB #10 (Figure D-21, right). In CMPT the pod is
no longer tracking the target, but attempts to keep the pod LOS pointed
at the last position tracked. Masking or clouds interfering with the LOS
to the tracked target are the most common events which cause CMPT.
Once the target is reacquired in the FOV, if the aircrew initiates a slew
input, the pod attempts to reenter PTRK or ATRK at the termination of
the slew. The pod will remain in CMPT for up to five seconds, after which
time, the pod defaults to a cue mode if track upgrade has not occurred.

Continuous Designation (CDES)
CDES is available in the PTRK, OTRK, and ATRK modes for only the
TGT and UPDT cursor functions. CDES is selectable at PB #1
(Figure D-22), and is boxed when active. The letter “C” will prefix the
current ranging sensor in priority above the selected cursor function at
PB #7 (Figure D-22).
In the TGT cursor function, CDES is only available using LAS, HRM, or
PASS as the priority sensor. Continuous designation is active while in the
TGT cursor function when all of the following conditions are satisfied.

e PTRK, ATRK, or OTRK is commanded

e CDES boxed at PB #1

e target designated via the TGT IR display

e no TDC slewing in progress; target automatically redesignates
once TDC slewing inputs terminate if previously in CDES

e LAS, HRM, or PASS sensor valid and selected
If the above conditions have been met, CLAS, CHRM, or CPASS is
displayed above TGT at PB #7 to indicate that the target is being
continuously designated using the specified sensor. CDES is interrupted
and the cues are removed above TGT at PB #7 at the occurrence of any of
the following:

e initiation of a slew command

e targeting pod enters CMPT

e = when the cursor function is changed

e the range source used (sensor in priority) becomes invalid

Figure D - 22. ATRK Continuous Designation.

Cursor Functions

You can designate the ground point under the cursor as a target (TGT),
update the INS, MN, or ALT (UPDT), cue an AGM-65 (CUE), or create a
mark point (MARK). You can select the appropriate cursor function by
repeated depressions of PB #7, or in the RCP by moving the castle switch
left for CUE/MARK, aft for TGT, or right for UPDT. Figure D-22 shows
the TGT option selected.


Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_38.jpeg:
Target

In TGT the ground point is designated as a target. This is done by placing
the point under the cursor and going full action on the RCP hand
controller trigger or depressing and releasing the TDC in the FCP.
DESIGNATE appears on the screen momentarily. Attack steering is now
available on the HUD if in the A/G master mode. With a designation,
AUTO delivery and A/G master mode selected, you will also have TPULL
or TREL displayed until weapon release. After weapon release
TPULL/TREL changes to TIMPCT (Figure D-22). If CDES is not boxed
and the operator attempts to fine tune the LOS or slews to a different
target, the target must be redesignated. In the auto bombing mode, if
AUTO or LAS is selected as the priority sensor, then laser is used if the
laser is firing and range is valid. If AGR is desired as the range source,
taking command of the TGT IR display a second time forces the radar into
AGR regardless of master mode selection as soon as the pod is slewed
within radar gimbal limits. If continuous designation is lost, CDES LOST
is indicated in the middle of the display and will be displayed for five
seconds. CDES LOST may occur at close range to the target, when target
size exceeds the track box display capability. When CDES is interrupted,
the designation remains on the last valid designation update until the
aircrew redesignates.

Cue
This option can be used to bring an AGM-65 line of sight to the TGT IR
LOS without designating a target. The same procedure as for TGT is

used, except CUE must appear above PB #7. Attack steering is not
provided on the HUD.

Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_39.jpeg:
Update

The UPDT cursor function allows you to update the INS, MN, or system
altitude. Cue the target pod to a well defined sequence point, like a
man-made object with vertical development, and select the update cursor
function. It is essential that the correct sequence point be indicated at

PB #17. At this time you can select either the MN, INS, or ALT for
update by toggling PB #16 to the desired update function. Manually slave
the pod line of sight over the update point. Once valid ranging is
established, position/altitude errors are displayed at PB #16

(Figure D-28).

Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_40.jpeg:
Position errors greater than 3000 feet are displayed in nautical miles.
Altitude errors are displayed in feet. A large error may indicate a
procedural error. You can command track (either PTRK or ATRK) if
desired. To obtain the most accurate ranging information, the laser
should be firing for the update; however, if the laser is safe or laser
ranging becomes invalid, then radar ranging data (AGR) is used if
available. Regardless of the priority sensor selection, the AGR is slaved to
the target pod LOS immediately if a second take command of the TGT IR
display is accomplished. This means that if the radar is operating (and is
not in either SNIFF, MRM support, or an acquisition mode), it is
commanded to AGR and slewed to the target pod LOS as soon as UPDT is
selected at PB #7 and the cursor is slewed or an update is commanded.
When you are confident that the pod is tracking the correct sequence point
and is using optimum ranging, accept the update by squeezing the hand
controller trigger to full action (RCP) or depressing/releasing the TDC
(FCP).

The update is successful if INS REJECT or INVALID is not displayed
with INS at PB #16. If you are updating the MN and mistakenly accept a
large update error, reset the MN on the UFC update select submenu. The
INS is protected against most update errors by the Kalman filter. The
MN accepts 100% of your update.

Mark

The MARK cursor function allows you to create mark points from the TGT
IR display. To create a mark point, select the MARK cursor function at
PB #7 by stepping through the cursor functions using PB #7 or by a left
movement of the RCP hand controller castle switch (left movement of the
castle switch toggles between CUE and MARK). The mark point is
created by depressing and releasing the FCP TDC or by full action on the
RCP hand controller trigger. “MARK XX” displays for five seconds in the
center of the TGT IR display (Figure D-24) and the mark point data is
stored in the CC buffer. It can also be written to the data transfer module
and is displayed on the UFC of the cockpit from which the point is created.
The mark point symbol will not be displayed on the TGT IR display. The
air-to-ground radar is commanded after mark point designation if the
targeting pod LOS is within the radar gimbal limits, and there is no
higher priority request for the AGR (track or acquisition mode). AGR
control in MARK is similar to UPDT.

Cue Modes

There are several methods available to the aircrew to cue the targeting
pod. Listed below are the types of sensors or sources used to aim the pod
and their associated legends.

RDR

TSD

NAV

HUD

LAN-3

Targeting pod cued from A/G RDR display. If the mission
sequence point under PB #17 on the A/G RDR display is not a
target offset, the pod will be cued to that point upon target
designation. If it is a target offset, the pod will be cued to the
actual target. In the cue cursor function the pod will cue to any
point under the crosshairs, regardless of the syntax at PB #17.
However, in the cue mode, AUTO sensor must be selected, or
LAS must be included in the MAN sensor hierarchy if that is to
be used.

Targeting pod cued from the TSD. When selecting FLIR at

PB #7 on the TSD, an arrowhead appears on the sensor pointing
cue. After slewing the arrowhead over the selected map area,
commanding FA on the RCP HC trigger, or TDC press/release
on the FCP throttle, will cue the pod to that point.

Targeting pod cued from NAV designation or quickstep method.
Four methods exist for the aircrew to NAV cue the pod on the
TGT IR display. Pressing PB #17 will sequence through all
mission points on the route. Selecting quickstep (FCP coolie up,
or RCP castle switch depress) sequences to the closest point
forward of the aircraft within 20 nm on the current route. If
there are no points forward of the aircraft within 20 nm, a SP
will be displayed at PB #17. Thereafter, quickstep numerically
selects the next mission point in sequence. The aircrew may
also type in a mission point in the UFC scratchpad and enter it
at PB #17.

Targeting pod cued from the HUD TD diamond. When the pilot
is in command of the HUD and either AUTO sensor is selected
or LAS is included in the MAN sensor hierarchy, the pod LOS is
slaved to the HUD TD diamond when a HUD designation occurs
or follows the pilot’s slew inputs without a designation.


Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_43.jpeg:
RET

STAB

SP

Targeting pod slaved to the A/G reticle. The pilot must be in
command of the HUD and take command a second time to cue
the pod to the A/G HUD reticle LOS. AUTO sensor must be
selected, or LAS must be included in the MAN sensor hierarchy,
with the pod in the A/G mode and not in any track mode.

Targeting pod commanded to space stabilized mode. The STAB
mode is considered a special type of cue mode. STAB is
displayed at PB #17 either by typing in zero on the UFC
scratchpad and entering it at PB #17, or holding the mode reject
switch (RCP) or auto acq switch (FCP) forward for greater than
one second. In either case, the pod LOS is commanded to a
three-degree down, zero-degree azimuth position, and is referred
to as the “snowplow” mode of operation (Figure D-25). Once in
snowplow, TDC inputs can be used to modify the space
stabilized LOS, but STAB will remain displayed at PB #17. If
the aircrew wishes to space stabilize the pod without initially
going to snowplow, holding aft on the mode reject switch (RCP)
or auto acq switch (FCP) for greater than one second will also
enter STAB at the current pod LOS. STAB is exited when either
track is commanded, the pod is cued by another source, MARK
or CUE designation occurs, or ground stabilization is
commanded via HOTAS.

Targeting pod commanded to ground stabilized mode. Holding
aft on the mode reject switch for greater than one second not
only enters the current pod LOS to STAB, but alternately selects
the ground stabilization mode and attempts to keep the pod LOS
on the point under the crosshairs without entering track. SP is
displayed at PB #17 when this mode is entered.


Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_44.jpeg:
The cue mode legends are displayed below the mission sequence point
under PB #17; or in the case of STAB or SP, directly under PB #17. The
targeting pod initializes to the wide field of view (WFOV) at power-up,
upon changing operating modes at PB #6 (A/A or A/G), or when cued using
any of the methods listed above. After cueing, TDC inputs to refine the
pod LOS varies depending on aircraft motion or position relative to the
ground point. The above modes are exited upon designation, or in the case
of the space stabilization mode, once STAB is exited. Below are the
legends displayed when these two things occur:

Laser Operation

The laser is primarily utilized for the delivery of laser guided munitions,
but it is also used to provide accurate ranging information for system
updates, target designations, and weapons release computations. There is
only one laser transmitter, but filtering techniques may be applied to
create either an eyesafe training mode (1.54 micron wavelength at 8
millijoules) or a tactical mode (1.06 micron wavelength at 100 millijoules)
of operation. The tactical laser is capable of ranging up to 13.2 nm with
an accuracy of 20 feet, while the training laser is limited to 3.5 nm when
the visibility is greater than 12 nm. Selection between modes is
accomplished on preflight by means of a mechanical switch on the exterior
of the targeting pod. A green (1.54) indication in the window means the
training mode is selected, while red (1.06) indicates that the tactical mode
is selected. It is not aircrew selectable once airborne. A “T” displayed on
the laser status window is also an indication the pod is in the training
mode.

Laser Arm
The laser is armed from the RCP TGT IR sensor control panel. Armed
indicators include ARM displayed at PB #19, an “L” displayed on the laser
status window (Figure D-26), a diamond placed over the HUD gun cross,
and an illuminated LASER ARMED advisory light in the FCP. It cannot
be armed until the following requirements are met.

e Laser arm switch in ARM

e Valid laser code entered

e Weight off wheels (WOW) and landing gear handle up

e System altitude less than 25,000 feet


Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_46.jpeg:
Laser Code

The laser is capable of emitting pulses at a PRF up to and including 20
pulses per second. The laser electronics is also capable of modulating the
emitted pulsed energy by transferring coded data from the pulse interval
modulator (PIM) module, which is selectively loaded onto the targeting
pod located on the BIT maintenance panel. A valid laser code is displayed
under the laser status at PB #19 (Figure D-26). An invalid laser code
flashes at PB #19 when the targeting pod is in operate with the laser
switch in SAFE or ARM. Specific codes are also assigned for types of laser
guided bombs, which is covered in a later lesson. Laser codes are keyed on
the UFC scratchpad and entered at PB #19 once the pod is in STBY or
ON. Any laser code ranging from 1XXX to 2XXX (X = 1-8) is valid for both
the tactical (combat) or training laser modes. Codes beginning with 1 are
used for PRF modulation, while codes beginning with 2 are used for PIM.
If a 2XXX code is entered the targeting pod itself must contain the PIM
module, otherwise the tactical laser will not arm or fire.

LAN-3 D - 40


Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_47.jpeg:
Laser Status

The TGT IR indicates the status of the laser in three different areas on
the display. First at PB #19, one of the following syntax may be displayed
(Figure D-27):

SAFE The laser switch is in SAFE, or in ARM but the aircraft is above
25,000 feet system altitude and has automatically safed the
laser.

ARM The laser switch is in ARM, but is not firing.
LASE The laser is firing; “LASE” also flashes when firing.

MASK _ The laser has been commanded to fire, but has been inhibited
due to the LOS being obscured by the aircraft structure. MASK
will only appear when LOS is obscured during LASE operation.
The TGT IR will reinitialize to LASE once the masking condition
is exited.

Secondly, at PB #20, under the azimuth and elevation values, the ranging
source will indicate whether or not the laser reflected energy is being
received and processed through the TGT IR pod (Figure D-27).

The laser status window located on the lower right corner of the TGT IR
display (Figure D-27) is the third indication of laser status. There are
three codes that may be displayed individually, or in conjunction with one
another and are listed below.

“T” - TRAINING LASER CUE. Displayed when the eyesafe training mode
has been selected. If the combat tactical laser is selected, the “T” is not
displayed.

“L” - LASER ARM CUE. Displayed on and steady when the laser switch
is set to ARM. Flashes when the laser is firing.

“M” - LASER MASK CUE. Displayed in conjunction with the MASK cue
at PB #19 to indicate LOS has been obscured. The laser is inhibited from
firing and the flashing “L” will become steady when “M” is displayed.
Flashing crosshairs are an early warning signal to the aircrew that a
masking condition is developing within 5° of mask zone.

NOTE

WARNING

Along the laser main beam LOS, the
tactical laser can be hazardous to
personnel on the ground or in other
aircraft within approximately 12 nm.

Do not fire the tactical laser within 1000
feet of personnel or other aircraft.
Reflected sidelobe energy may cause eye
damage. Never lase inhabited areas.

CAUTION

The targeting pod may be fired up to
25,000 feet system altitude. Above
25,000 feet system altitude, the targeting
pod protects itself and will not arm or
fire. Any attempt to arm or fire the laser
above 25,000 feet system altitude results
in the following: TGT IR display
symbology indicates SAFE, L does not
appear, and the laser will not arm or fire.
The laser arm switch may be placed in
ARM between 25,000 and 40,000 feet
with no negative consequences. In this
situation the laser will arm when the
aircraft descends below 25,000 feet.

The training laser is not suitable for employment of laser guided

munitions.

NOTE

LANTIRN pods must be turned off above 40,000 feet or if greater than
Mach 1.2 or 650 KCAS to prevent damage.

Auto/Manual Lase

The aircrew can manually lase (MLAS) or have the targeting pod
automatically lase (ALAS) the target during a laser guided bomb (LGB)
weapons delivery profile. To program a manual or auto lase time, the
aircrew must first select a LGB or SUU-20 in the A/G PACS. Once this is
accomplished, the aircrew needs to go to an A/G delivery display and enter
the PROG PAGE by depressing PB #1. The current MLAS/ALAS
programmed time will be displayed above PB #8 (Figure D-28). Allowable
lase times range from 0:01 to 1:30, or CONT (continuous). Toggling PB #8
with a blank UFC scratchpad alternates between MLAS and ALAS. To
input a time, simply type the number of seconds on the UFC, up to 1:30,
and depress PB #8. If colons are used, two numeric digits must be added
prior to entering or it will flash on the scratchpad as an invalid input. If
CONT lase is desired, simply type “C” on the UFC scratchpad and enter at
PB #8.

NOTE

Only lase times of 12, 15, 20 seconds, or CONT can be selected for the
GBU-24.

Once the lase times have been programmed, the aircrew must select
either a MLAS or ALAS function on the TGT IR display at PB #18 while
in the A/G mode (Figure D-29). During MLAS operation, the time input
and displayed is just a visual cue to remind the aircrew of desired
terminal laser fire guidance time. The aircrew must still manually
actuate laser fire via HOTAS. During ALAS operation, the laser will
automatically fire when the programmed time matches TIMPCT, and will
continue to fire until either TIMPCT terminates (--) plus 10 seconds (or
10% of the total TOF of the weapon, whichever greater), or the aircrew
manually terminates laser fire via HOTAS or switches laser to SAFE.
MLAS or ALAS times are displayed above the sighting index (crosshairs)
to the left, while TREL or TPULL (prior to weapons release) and TIMPCT
(after release), are displayed directly above the crosshairs (Figure D-29).
In both operating modes the laser must be armed and the aircrew must
ensure the target is continuously being tracked via the crosshairs until
weapons impact.

Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_53.jpeg:
A typical ALAS profile is outlined below.

e Target acquired and tracked via TGT IR display. ALAS selected
at PB #18 with a programmed time of 0:15.

e Aircrew manually fires laser for update, redesignation, and
accurate ranging for weapons release.

e At TREL = 0, weapon is released with a TIMPCT of 0:25
displayed, and the laser is turned off automatically. “ALAS” at
PB #18 begins flashing, indicating that the laser is being
controlled automatically.

@ When TIMPCT counts down through 0:15 (for the last weapon
released in a ripple delivery) the laser automatically turns back
on.

e At the termination of TIMPCT (--) plus 10 seconds or 10%
(normally 10 seconds, unless you drop a weapon with a TOF
greater than 100 seconds), the laser is automatically turned off.
Aircrew will probably manually turn off the laser via HOTAS
once impact is observed (“splash”) to preclude the laser from
wandering and interfering with other weapons being guided in
the target area.

ALAS is displayed steady prior to weapons release, and upon actuation of
the laser fire button, the laser will turn on and off. When “ALAS” is
flashing with a LGB in flight, any actuation of the laser fire button will
revert the targeting pod to the MLAS mode of operation. If the laser is
firing at the time of button actuation, the laser will be turned off
immediately. If the laser is off with “ALAS” flashing, the laser will be
turned on immediately, but since it will be in the MLAS mode, the aircrew
must now remember to turn the laser off manually. If PB #18 is toggled
while ALAS is flashing, it will revert to MLAS with laser off, regardless of
laser status at that moment. ALAS remains active in masking conditions,
and will resume laser fire once the masking condition is exited.

NOTE

When “MASK” is displayed at PB #19, the laser is being commanded to
fire, and only inhibited due to the masking condition. Once masking is
exited, the laser will continue to fire. If the laser has been commanded to
stop fire while in a masking condition, “ARM” rather than “MASK” will be
displayed at PB #19.



Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_54.jpeg:
If the targeting pod is in the MLAS mode with a LGB already in flight,
and the aircrew toggles PB #18 to ALAS, ALAS begins to flash and the
laser will fire immediately if the ALAS time is greater than TIMPCT, or
will turn on according to the ALAS profile. Proper setup of the TGT IR
display prior to weapons release will preclude having to make these type
of switch changes.

Targeting Pod Malfunctions

TGT POD HOT Caution

The TGT POD HOT caution legend appears on the MPD/MPCD, where
other cautions appear, to indicate that the pod is overheating

(Figure D-30). Turn the TGT FLIR off for 1 minute, then on. If the
overheat condition returns, turn the TGT FLIR off. Continued use will
result in internal damage and failure.

Laser Failure

To aid the aircrew in determining if the laser is operational, the word
FAIL is displayed below PB #19 and LASER FAIL is continuously
displayed in the lower message window (on all the A/A and A/G T1 and T2
displays) whenever the targeting pod reports any of the following laser
BIT failures:

e LASER XMTR
e LASER HVPS
e LASER RANGER

The display of FAIL and LASER FAIL is not dependent on the current
laser status (SAFE, ARM, LASE) displayed at PB #19 (Figure D-31). The
display of FAIL is not dependent on the current targeting pod mode (OFF,
STBY, OPR, RDY, NRDY); however, LASER FAIL can only be displayed
after the targeting pod has unstowed and one of the three previously
mentioned failures exists. (All other five-second cues displayed in the
lower message window have priority over LASER FAIL.) The aircrew can
acknowledge and remove the LASER FAIL cue by pressing PB #19 with
an empty scratchpad. If LASER FAIL is selected for removal and at least
one of the failures still exists, the cue does not reappear when additional
failures occur or disappear, but does reappear if the targeting pod power
status changes or if PB #19 is pressed with an empty scratchpad.
Additionally, if the aircrew attempts to fire the laser after the LASER
FAIL cue has been removed, the cue reappears.

IR PLANNING

Mission planning for IR sensors is more technical than radar planning and
may require the support of professional weather personnel experienced in
the use of the tactical decision aid (TDA) computerized planning model.
This model provides the crew with a prediction of IR sensor effective
ranges for the LANTIRN navigation pod, targeting pod, and IR weapons
under various conditions. This information is critical for low-level pacing
and for determining the appropriate ranges for target attack maneuvers.
Aircrews have to make the appropriate inputs to weather personnel and
plan mission events based on the information provided. Additionally,
aircrews should be able to determine approximate sensor ranges based on
Delta T and transmissivity values provided by weather personnel.

A sample planning flimsy is shown in Figure D-32.

Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_61.jpeg:
Table D-2 provides a detection range once the Delta T and transmissivity
are known. In addition to determining the approximate range at which
detection occurs, it is also important to consider the types of points to be
selected during targeting pod updates. Vertically developed objects such
as buildings, water tanks, and towers are suitable update points.
Experience has shown that objects close to course are easier to track with
the targeting pod since the angular change during slewing is primarily in
elevation as the aircraft nears the point. The targeting pod handles
elevation changes fairly well. Update points well off the course line
(greater than 2 nm) present rapid azimuth changes as the aircraft
approaches the point and makes initial tracking difficult. The targeting
pod does not slew as well with rapid azimuth changes.

Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_62.jpeg:
Target IR Planning

A successful attack or LGB delivery using the TGT IR for designations
and deliveries or updates starts on the ground with TGT study and TGT
FOV predictions. Using the TDA from the weather shop is the first tool in
determining what IR conditions, and therefore, pickup ranges you can
expect.

The next step is determining what you can expect to see in the targeting
pod once you start using it for either updates or attacks. Just like radar
work, you have to come up with FOV prediction for the TGT IR. The
principles are basically the same; you have to work big-to-small if you
want to find your exact DMPI or update point.

The big differences between TGT IR and radar prediction is in TGT IR you
are looking for objects with different temperature signatures as compared
to radar where you are looking for higher energy reflections. Unlike radar
predictions, the footprint of a TGT IR prediction and what you actually see
on the scope is not the same in width and length. For example, if you are
at 10,000 feet AGL and you take a radar patch map (DW-3.3) of a TGT or
aim point which is 10 miles away, you always get a map that covers a
ground distance 3.3 miles wide and 3.3 miles long. If you take a look in
the TGT IR at the same point, the picture you will see on your scope would
cover a ground distance of 6307 feet in width in the middle of the display
and a length of 48,060 feet or 7.1 miles.

Since the picture that you see on your display is the “same” length and
width, you are looking at a compressed picture in length compared to its
width. This is caused by looking at the ground with a circular sensor at
an angle of less than 90 degrees as if you would take a flashlight and
shine it onto the ground. If you look down at an angle of 90 degrees, the
picture would be a circle; if you aim at an angle, you would get an
oval-shaped picture. The shallower the angle gets or the lower you fly, the
more ground distance you cover in length up to a point where you look
into infinity and you have the horizon in the top part of your TGT IR
(Figure D-38).

Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_64.jpeg:
If you are a math major you probably take pride in figuring out these
distances through trigonometric formulas. Fortunately both squadrons
have programs called TGT Pod FOV Simulator on their computers. You
just insert a ground range and altitude and get all distances and angles
needed to make a good FOV prediction (Figure D-34). Next let us look at
an example on how to actually work with all these tools. You are
supposed to attack a building—Tryon Palace—in the town of New Bern.
You are coming home from Dare at 10,000 feet and with a heading of 260°.
The weather is good and you can expect IR pickup ranges in excess of

10 miles. Usually you would ask for a TDA as described in the previous
paragraph to find out what ranges you can expect. In this example or
with good IR visibility, you typically would make a prediction for a range
to TGT of about 30 seconds TREL or between 5 to 10 miles for a medium
level delivery.

First you need to get a map or an AFMSS imagery of the target area and
plot out the coordinates. Get a FOV prediction from the computers
(Figure D-34). Next, draw a radar prediction of the target area (you
always want to start out with a radar designation) (Figure D-35).

After that is done, plot the TGT FOVs on either the AFMSS printout or
the 50,000 map. Always start at your DMPI and work from there. A good
technique is to divide the footprint into quarters and then divide those
into thirds up and down. It should look like a puzzle that is finished after
you are done with that (Figure D-36, top).

Now you can do the same roster with equal squares on the FOV sheet
(Figure D-36, bottom left) and start copying the individual squares from
the map onto the FOV sheet (Figure D-36, bottom right). The result
should look like the picture in Figure D-37.

TEXT
INTRODUCTION

The targeting IR (TGT IR) system, or sometimes referred to as the target
FLIR (TGT FLIR), is the other half of the F-15E’s infrared, “see in the
dark” capability. You can use it to update system altitude, INS, or MN
present position; to designate and attack a target; to hand off to an IR
Maverick; and even to buddy lase for another attacker. Its high resolution
presentation gives a television-like picture, making most features readily
identifiable. It can be pointed by the mission navigator but because of its
limited field of view and range, it is best aimed (cued) by the radar. You
can command automatic cueing or manually slave the pod.

DESCRIPTION
Pod

Carried on its pylon on the underside of the left engine area, the TGT IR
pod (with adapter) weighs about 621 lbs (525 lbs without the adapter)
(Figure D-1). It contains the IR sensor, a pockels cell, Q-switched
Neodymium doped Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (Nd:YAG) laser, power
supply, environmental control unit, and associated computers/control
units. In general, it “looks” down/aft in a hemisphere relative to the
fuselage line and wingline with an aft blind zone caused by the pod itself
(Figure D-2). It can also “look” up but aircraft surfaces, external stores,
and the NAV pod limit the view.

Power Switch

This three-position toggle switch controls electrical power to the pod. OFF
removes all power from the unit, STBY applies cooldown power and allows
adjustment functions. ON provides full operation and enables laser
arm/fire.

NOTE
If the pod is cycled OFF, wait 1 minute before cycling power to ON.
