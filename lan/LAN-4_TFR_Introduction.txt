AIR COMBAT COMMAND


Text from LAN-4_TFR_Introduction_page_10.jpeg:
When the TFR detects terrain in a bar scan, it stores the range and
elevation of that return in memory. Between scans of that bar, it
estimates the range and elevation of the terrain by using the aircraft’s
groundspeed and flight vector provided by the INS. A complete 8-bar scan
requires 2.5 seconds. In wings level flight, the center bar is scanned twice,
once every 1.25 seconds.

In certain TFR modes, the scan pattern is modified to provide different
capabilities. Those differences will be discussed in LAN-6.

TF Command Logic

Once the returns from the TF radar are stored in memory, the TF
computer in the LANTIRN NAV Pod uses them to compute the g
command required to maintain the SC. The TF computer compares the
stored terrain information with a model of “command lines.” The lines
represent the incremental g required to cross an obstacle at the SC. As
the aircraft flies over level ground in Figure D-3, the ground returns
coincide with the zero command line. This indicates no incremental g is
required to maintain SC.

Text from LAN-4_TFR_Introduction_page_11.jpeg:
The peak in Figure D-4 eventually penetrates the zero command line
(ZCL), indicating that a positive incremental g command is required to
maintain SC. The further the terrain penetrates through the ZCL, the
greater the g command required to maintain the selected clearance, as
shown by the +1 G and +2 G lines. As the aircraft clears the peak, the
terrain on the far side will fall in the negative G region, indicating that a
pushover command is required to maintain SC.

The clearance monitor region is an area in front of the aircraft monitored
by the TF computer. Any object entering the area will generate a fly-up
command by the TF computer.

TF Command Corridor

The TF computer stores terrain information from all bars in the scan. Not
all of that information is necessary for generating TF commands. The
only terrain that requires climb or dive commands is that which falls
along the flight vector. To prevent unnecessary climb commands for
terrain left or right of the aircraft’s flight path, the TF computer
determines a “command corridor” based on the aircraft's projected
groundtrack.

In wings level flight, the command corridor consists only of the center bar.
When the aircraft begins a turn, the command corridor shifts to include
some or all of the other bars in the direction of the turn as shown in
Figure D-6. The number of bars included depends on the groundspeed
and turn rate. The TF computer now generates commands based on the
composite of terrain from all bars within the command corridor.

Radar Altimeter Commands

At times, such as flying over smooth water or dry lakes, there may be no
TF radar returns to provide a g command. In these circumstances, the
“NO TERRAIN” caution will be displayed and the TF computer uses the
radar altimeter to compute the required g command by comparing current
radar altitude to SC.

E-SCOPE PRESENTATION

The format for displaying TFR returns is known as an E-scope. An
E-scope display is very similar to the B-scope used for air-to-air radars,
with two important differences. First, the E-scope displays elevation
versus range instead of azimuth versus range. Second, the range scale on
the E-scope is nonlinear. The E-scope in the F-15E has a maximum
display range of 10 nm, but the first 2 nm take up almost half of the
display. This apparent “range distortion” provides greater detail of the
terrain closest to the aircraft since that is the terrain most likely to
produce “g” commands.

LAN-4 D-8


Text from LAN-4_TFR_Introduction_page_15.jpeg:
The shape of the returns of an E-scope can best be understood by
constructing the returns for a simple case such as the one shown in Figure
D-7. The aircraft in this diagram is flying at 1000 feet AGL and is
approaching a 1000-foot hill. Assuming the aircraft is in level flight, the
TFR antenna is scanning +10° and -20° relative to the flight vector. Since
the terrain between the aircraft and the hill is flat, we can use simple

trigonometry to compute the range at which a given scan angle intersects
the ground.

its scan angle is different. This results in a “spike” on the E-scope. If all
the returns are plotted and connected, you get the curved display as seen

TF DISPLAY INTERPRETATION

The TF display has several important functions. It provides an overall
“confidence check” that the TF system is operating properly, permits the
crew to anticipate climb or dive commands, and allows detection of
weather and electronic countermeasures. Your ability to interpret it
quickly is essential to your success in TFR operations. This section
discusses the basic elements of the TF display and how they relate to
terrain returns.

Zero Command Line

The zero command line (ZCL) is a graphic representation of the zero
incremental g line that the TF computer uses as a command model

(Figure D-9).

It is an indication of where the aircraft is flying relative to the SC. Ifthe
ground is coincident with the zero command line, i.e., moving from right to
left along the zero command line, the aircraft is at the desired SC for that
particular distance and there is no change in the present g’s being
commanded. If the ground is to the right of the zero command line, the
aircraft is flying high. If the ground is to the left, the aircraft is low. The
ZCL is dynamic and changes as SC and ground speed change (Figure D-10
and Figure D-11).

Obstacle Warning Line (OWL)

This line is located to the left of the zero command line (Figure D-12). Its
purpose is to provide you with a warning of approaching terrain that
requires 2 Gs to clear (keeping in mind that 2 incremental Gs is the limit
of normal TF operations). If the synthetic video penetrates this line, the
voice warning, OBSTACLE AHEAD is activated and continues until the
aircraft has climbed to where the terrain returns below the OWL.

Aircraft Flight Vector Line

This line depicts the flight path of the aircraft (Figure D-12). It is
dynamic as it travels up and down the display portraying climbs and
dives. It provides the same type of information concerning the aircraft’s
relationship to the ground as the velocity vector does in the HUD except
that on the TF display you can also determine the range at which your
flight path intersects the ground. During a TF climb to clear high terrain,
such as a peak, the flight vector line provides an immediate crosscheck
that the TF command will provide terrain clearance.

TF Raw Video Position Indicator

At the top right of the TF display is a raw video position indicator (Figure
D-13). The dot on this scale represents the azimuth of the TF bar scan
from which the raw video is selected. The indicated bar is the center bar
when straight and level, and the outside bar of the command corridor
when in a turn. The raw video position indicator provides a confidence
check that the command corridor and lead-into-turn features are
functioning properly. As the aircraft begins a turn the dot should shift in
the direction of the turn.

Pitch Command and Attitude

At the top left portion of the display is the command steering and attitude
display (Figure D-13). An artificial horizon and either a manual TF
steering box, auto TF solid bar or dashed ATF bar (blended mode) is
presented (depends upon the mode). A circle representing the velocity
vector is presented for reference to the steering bars/box.

Minimum En Route Altitude

The MEA is always displayed on the E-scope display while operating
during terrain following (Figure D-13). The MEA can be set in 1-foot
increments from 400 to 30,000 feet via the UFC or through AFMSS, and
loaded into the MC/DTM. MEA values are zeroed out and MEA OFF is
displayed on the TF display when no MEA has been entered in the UFC
point data submenu. The MEA displayed will be for the current aircraft
sequence point.

Terrain Video

There are two types of terrain video displayed; one is synthetic, and the
other is raw. Synthetic is video stored by the TF computer and displayed
at full intensity out to 6 nm. As seen in Figure D-14, it contains terrain
data along the projected flight path of the aircraft and is updated every
0.5 seconds. All terrain following commands are generated from this
video. Raw video is displayed at half intensity out to 10 nm. Raw returns
are updated every 1.25 seconds during straight and level flight and every
2.5 seconds during turns. Raw video provides the crew with confidence of
proper TF radar operation, and is also used to detect weather and
jamming. The displayed raw video comes from only one selected bar; the
center bar when wings are level and the outer bar of the command
corridor when turning.

Different terrain features produce different displays. Lakes, sand dunes,
snow or other low reflectivity terrain will occasionally appear as a
NO-SHOW area on the TF display (Figure D-16). Note that the video, if
extended through the NO-SHOW, would join into a continuous smooth

curve, similar to level ground.

Text from LAN-4_TFR_Introduction_page_24.jpeg:
Mountainous terrain or hills produce spikes in the video. If there is a hill,
the display has a spike followed by a shadow (blank area). The terrain
behind the hill produces returns at the line-of-sight angle (Figure D-17).
Valleys produce displays that have shadows, however the returns display
at a lower angle and a greater range.

From a practical standpoint, the TF display produces a series of spikes
and shadows as the terrain changes. If the ground returns, mountains,
valleys, or level ground ride along the ZCL, you are at the correct altitude.
If the returns penetrate the ZCL, anticipate a climb command. Ifthe
ground returns are to the right of the ZCL anticipate a descent command.
If the returns have penetrated the ZCL and are rapidly approaching the
OWL, anticipate a flyup command when the returns penetrate the OWL.
You can use the velocity vector to determine the point where the current
aircraft flight vector would impact the ground if nothing were to change.

MANUAL, AUTO AND BLENDED TFR

The aircrew can select manual, auto or blended TF operations to follow
the TFR command steering. During manual TF operations, the pilot
manually flies the command steering by centering the velocity vector in
the manual terrain following box (MTF Box). During auto TF operations,
the TF system is coupled to the autopilot and the AFCS flies the command
steering. During coupled altitude hold and terrain following (blended)
mode, the aircrew designates an altitude (radar or baro) to maintain until
the terrain is within TF minimums. At this point AUTO TFR takes over
until the obstacle is cleared. The aircraft then recovers to the preset
RADAR or BARO altitude.

Manual TF operation can be performed in an armed or unarmed condition.
Armed manual provides a fail-safe protection that automatically flies the
aircraft away from the ground when a system failure or unsafe condition
exists. Unarmed manual provides flyup cues but does not automatically
fly the aircraft away from the ground.

During auto TF, automatic flyup protection is always provided, again
automatically flying the aircraft away from the ground. Fail-safe flyups
and TFR operations will be addressed in LAN-6 and LAN-7.

TFR INTERFACES
Displays Crosscheck

TFR information is presented on the HUD, HUD repeater, ADI and the
TF display. The HUD is the primary display for TF operations. The
combination of NAV FLIR video and TFR command steering allows for a
big picture understanding of the TF environment and flexible tactics, and
terrain masking. Although the UFC may be used to change the SC, the
TF display is the best source for TF parameter controls and is used to aid
in the interpretation of terrain and flight path corrections needed during
TFR flight. The ADI is especially useful anytime the HUD attitude
information is difficult to interpret (e.g., recovery from a loft maneuver).


Text from LAN-4_TFR_Introduction_page_26.jpeg:
Systems Interface

TF COMPUTER

The TF computer receives information from the INS, TF radar and radar
altimeter to determine the appropriate vertical g-command to maintain
the selected clearance. This value is used to provide a g-command to the
automatic flight control system (AFCS) while in auto TF, or to provide
pitch steering in manual TF.

CC/MPDP

The CC generates the appropriate steering symbols, cautions and
warnings. The MPDP provides the power to the display and is the backup
to the CC in controlling mux bus messages during manual TF.

FCC

The FCC allows the engagement/disengagement and interruption of
armed TF (manual or auto). The FCC controls basic CAS actuator and
sensor operation, and responds to signals coming into the AFCS. These
signals include the TF couple, flyup enable and radar altimeter override
switch positions. In addition, the FCC performs several monitoring
functions. These functions are: a low altitude monitor (LAM), flight path
angle monitor (FPAM), and an airspeed monitor. The FCC is also the
source of flyup commands in auto and armed manual TFR. Flyups are
discussed further in LAN-6.

INS

INS data must be valid for proper TF operation. The data provided and
compared is vertical velocity, pitch attitude and roll attitude. If both sets
of data are invalid, then a subsequent flyup is generated using AHRS

attitudes for reference.

Radar Altimeter

The radar altimeter is used by the NAV pod for altitude and terrain
information when the TF radar does not see terrain. AIUs pass radar
altimeter information from the radar altimeter to the TF computer and
FCC. Data from both AIUs must be valid at 500 feet and below. The
lesser of the two AIUs altitudes is used in the FCC's TF logic and the low
altitude monitoring system. If the two altitudes differ by more than 30
feet at SCs below 500 feet, radar altitude is considered invalid and a flyup
results.

The information used to fly manual or auto TF comes from several
subsystems and a basic understanding of this interfacing is helpful. But a
solid understanding of TF principles, E-scope presentation and
interpretation is fundamental for safe terrain following operations.

LANTIRN OVERVIEW
F-15E Terrain Following Capability

The navigation pod contains the NAV FLIR, which allows the crew to
“see” ahead at night, and a terrain following radar (TFR) which provides
manual and automatic TF capabilities. This workbook addresses the TFR
logic and displays; however, it is important to recognize the TFR and NAV
FLIR are used together during TFR operations. Most of the time the
aircrew will reference the FLIR image and fly the TFR symbology
commands displayed in the HUD.

TFR Associated Systems

The primary associated systems for TF operations are the NAV pod,
AFCS, radar altimeter, AIUs and the central computer (CC). The TF
computer receives information from the INS, TF radar and radar
altimeter. It then determines the appropriate vertical g command, which
is sent to the automatic flight control system (AFCS) while in auto TF or
depicted by a pitch command box in manual TF. The CC displays the
appropriate steering symbols, cautions and warnings on the HUD/ HUD
repeater, ADI and TF displays.

TFR PRINCIPLES

The purpose of a terrain following radar system is to scan the terrain
ahead of the aircraft, determine which terrain will fall in the projected
flight path, and generate climb and dive commands to maintain the
selected reference altitude. This selected reference altitude is known as
the set clearance limit, or SC. This section explains the nature of a TF
radar scan, and how the returns from that radar are used to generate
command steering.


Text from LAN-4_TFR_Introduction_page_8.jpeg:
TF Radar Scan

The TFR scans in both a vertical (“nodding”) and a horizontal (“sweeping”)
plane relative to the earth, using a 5.5° beam of pulsed energy to detect
obstacles within the scan. In the normal mode, the antenna scans in
elevation from +10° to -20°, referenced to the velocity vector in a climb or
level flight, and referenced to % the dive angle in a dive (Figure D-1).
