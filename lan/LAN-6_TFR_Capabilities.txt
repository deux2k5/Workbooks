AIR COMBAT COMMAND


Text from LAN-6_TFR_Capabilities_page_10.jpeg:
ECCM

The ECCM mode (Figure D-4) is designed to provide maximum capability
when operating in a jamming environment. The frequency is controlled
by the system; therefore, frequency selection is removed from the display.
Jamming may be detected on the TF display as “grassy” returns, both
above and below the SC. Very powerful jamming may still result in a
flyup command. ECCM should not be used continuously in place of
NORM as a precaution against jamming but rather, should be selected
when needed and deselected when no longer needed. Circular polarization
makes the TFR less sensitive to small radar cross section (RCS) obstacles
such as towers. Also, the +5° to -20° scan pattern and 15,000 foot
command range reduces the climb peak height capability in steep terrain.

LPI

To decrease the probability of enemy detection, low probability of intercept
(LPI) mode may be used. LPI is selected by pressing the EMIS LMT
button or by boxing LPI on the TF display. LPI uses a 1-bar scan every
2.5 seconds. Between scans the antenna does not transmit and is stowed
down and to the left (Figure D-5). As a result, the turn rate is limited to
0.5°/second (approximately 10-12° of bank at normal low level speeds).
Like NORM, LPI has some auto ECCM features and can be used at the
same SCs. Unlike NORM, when in LPI, the TF radar does not
lead-into-turns. Like ECCM, frequency selection is not available. The
radar altimeter must be functional to use the LPI mode; OVERRIDE
cannot be used.

Text from LAN-6_TFR_Capabilities_page_12.jpeg:
Very Low Clearance (VLC)

VLC allows terrain following capability down to 100 feet. It employs a
2-bar scan pattern and scans every 0.5 seconds. Turn rate is limited to
2°/second at SCs of 200-1000 feet (approximately 40° of bank at normal
low level speeds), and is limited to 1°/second for 100 feet (approximately
20° of bank at normal low level speeds). Since VLC’s 2-bar scan spends
more time looking along the aircraft’s flight path, you may wish to employ
this mode if flying over terrain with low reflectivity, such as sand dunes,
or if the route of flight has obstacles such as radio towers. Like LPI, the
radar altimeter must be functional to use VLC.

NOTE

Terrain following should not be attempted against extended slopes or a
series of multiple obstacles along the flight path which would require a
continuous climb exceeding 20°. An extended slope is defined as upwardly
sloping terrain which continues for 3 nm or more.

The maximum isolated obstacle heights for straight (turn rate less than
0.5°/second) and turning flight are defined below. For each condition the
ground speed must be maintained at or above 400 knots which may
require afterburner. These limits should also be applied against sheer
vertical obstacles with a slope greater than 20°.

Cautions (Displays)
See Figure D-6 for locations of cautions on the various displays.

N-F LOS

The N-F LOS caution appears on the HUD if NAV FLIR video is displayed
on the HUD, and NAV FLIR line of sight is out of tolerance (more than 13
mils). Corrective action is to reboresight the NAV FLIR.

ROLL

When the aircraft bank angle exceeds 60° the ROLL caution is displayed.
Decreasing the bank angle to 60° removes the caution.

TURN RATE

When the turn rate limit of the selected mode exceeds the dynamic bank
angle indices (bank carets), the TURN RATE caution is displayed.

TURN ACCEL

The TURN ACCEL caution is activated when 2.2°/second’ acceleration is
exceeded.

DIVE ANGLE

When dive angle is equal to or greater than 15°, the DIVE ANGLE
caution is displayed. In armed manual TF, a dive angle greater than 15°
will generate a flyup after 3 seconds.

INS LIMIT

INS LIMIT appears if drift angle (10°), pitch angle (+40°, -20°), or the
outer roll angle (85°) limits have been exceeded. This is an indication that
the TF radar antenna gimbal limits have been exceeded. INS LIMIT is
also displayed momentarily following recovery from a non-TF maneuver or
during TF start-up.

LAN-6 D-8


Text from LAN-6_TFR_Capabilities_page_15.jpeg:
AIRSPEED
AIRSPEED is displayed when flying either too slow or too fast.

e Asyour ground speed drops to 400 knots or below, AIRSPEED comes
on steady to tell you that you are outside of the TF algorithm design.

e As your ground speed drops to between 370 KCAS and 360 KCAS,
AIRSPEED flashes to show that you are below the airspeed for which
auto flyups were designed.

e The steering and HUD TF display is removed (and automatic flyup is
disenabled) if ground speed drops below 360 knots.

@ When accelerating, a flashing AIRSPEED is displayed at .97 Mach to
indicate that you are exceeding the specification limit of the TF radar
algorithm design.

The flashing caution has priority over the steady caution.

NO TERRAIN

NO TERRAIN appears when altitude, attitude, or terrain type prevents
the TF radar from receiving ground returns within a -2 G incremental
envelope (-1 G for 1000 feet SC). The NO TERRAIN caution will usually
be present in level flight above approximately 2000 feet AGL. It should go
out during the TF descent. NO TERRAIN is inhibited in the blended
mode.

ECCM

ECCM is an advisory cue displayed when the system detects a jamming
environment which may interfere with TF radar operation.

N-F BRST

The N-F BRST caution is displayed on the HUD when NAV FLIR is
selected for HUD display and the NAV pod is in boresight mode.


Text from LAN-6_TFR_Capabilities_page_16.jpeg:
Turn Caution Windows

OBST is displayed left and/or right to alert you of terrain that would
present an obstacle to your flight path if you turned. When in auto TF
and coupled to a steering mode, turns in the direction of the OBST caution
are inhibited until the obstacle is passed. Coupled steering will resume
two seconds after the caution is removed. When an OBST turn caution
occurs opposite to the turn direction, the aircraft can maneuver in roll
between the maximum TF bank angle limit in the current turn direction
and wings level flight. During manual TF, if a turn caution is displayed
in the direction the aircraft is turning, the pilot should immediately roll
wings level.

Warnings

All TF warnings, except FLYUP, UNARMED, and NO ATF, activate an
auto flyup if in auto or armed manual TF. During unarmed manual TF,
they provide +2 G pitch steering in the HUD, ADI, and TF display. See
Figure D-6 for locations of warnings on the various displays.

FLYUP

FLYUP is displayed when a flyup is initiated (auto TF or armed manual)
or required (unarmed manual). The FLYUP caution is to alert the crew to
take control of the aircraft and complete the flyup maneuver.

UNARMED

When armed flyup protection has been requested with the flyup enable
switch or TF couple switch, the UNARMED caution is displayed because
the paddle switch is being held or the aircraft is outside the 40° pitch limit
of the flyup envelope. This leaves the system in unarmed manual TF.

NO ATF
When auto TF has been requested with the TF couple switch, the NO ATF

caution is displayed because the paddle switch is being held. This leaves
the system in unarmed manual.

LAN-6 D-10


Text from LAN-6_TFR_Capabilities_page_17.jpeg:
TF FAIL

The TF FAIL caution is displayed when a TF system component failure is
experienced or, when in ATF, bank angle, turn rate, turn acceleration,
dive angle or pitch angle limits are exceeded.

OBSTACLE or G-LIMIT

When an obstacle is detected ahead that is within the aircraft’s flight path
and requires more than 2 incremental Gs to clear, OBSTACLE warnings
are displayed on the HUD, ADI, and TF display. The G-LIMIT warning is
displayed only for a brief instant and may not be seen by the aircrew. In
addition, the OBST warning lights in both cockpits illuminate. The voice
warning (“OBSTACLE AHEAD”) is repeated until the system determines
the object no longer constitutes a problem. If in auto or armed manual
TF, a flyup is commanded. The OBSTACLE warning occurs if terrain
returns touch the OBSTACLE warning line on the TF display. The pilot
must assist the flyup to ensure terrain clearance.

TF LOW

The NAV pod and FCC both contain low altitude monitors (LAMs) that
predict and indicate when the aircraft will descend below 75% of the SC,
based on radar altitude and vertical velocity. The TF LOW warning is
shown on the HUD, ADI, and TF display. Also, the LOW ALT warning
light is activated. No voice warning will be activated for TF LOW. If in
auto TF or armed manual TF, a flyup is commanded. If in unarmed
manual TF, the pitch command box provides pitch steering for a flyup.

TF Advisories and Associated Lights

Two lights which are directly related to TF operations are the A/P light in
both cockpits and the UNARMED/NO ATF light in the rear cockpit only.

The autopilot (A/P) status light is a green status light located just above
the utility hydraulic gauge in the front cockpit and above the right MPD
in the rear cockpit. This light illuminates when both auto TFR is coupled
and an autopilot steer mode is engaged.


Text from LAN-6_TFR_Capabilities_page_18.jpeg:
The aft cockpit amber UNARMED/NO ATF light illuminates for any of the
conditions that cause the UNARMED and NO ATF display warnings (TF
system not armed; auto TF requested, but not controlling the aircraft;
brute force disengagements) and also if manual TF is conducted with the
flyup enable switch in OFF.

NOTE

The “BINK-BINK’” tone is activated whenever the UNARMED/NO ATF
light comes ON. The BINK-BINK tone will not sound until higher priority
voice warnings have cleared.

FLYUPS
There are two basic types of flyups: automatic and manual.

Automatic flyups, which are generated during auto TF or armed manual
TF, are 2 to 3 G incremental pull-ups commanded through the flight
control system. Automatic flyups which occur when the AFCS is fully
functional are roll compensated; the system rolls the aircraft to wings
level while pulling up to accomplish the flyup maneuver.

Manual flyups are accomplished through crew flight control inputs during
unarmed manual TF in response to TF steering commands and warning
cues.

Flyup Initiation

Flyups are generated in auto and manual modes due to violation of 75% of
set clearance (TF LOW), a detected object that requires more than 2 Gs to
clear (OBSTACLE or G-LIMIT), or a TF component failure (TF FAIL).
When the flyup is initiated, the FLYUP warning is displayed along with
the TF FAIL, OBSTACLE, or LOW ALTITUDE warning light.

LAN-6 D-12


Text from LAN-6_TFR_Capabilities_page_19.jpeg:
Auto TF Flyups

During auto TF, flyups are also caused by exceeding the limits in
Table D-1.

Table D- 1. TF Limits.

Auto TF cockpit cues for flyups due to exceeding TF Limits are:

e AFCS initiated flyup

e TF FAIL - Voice warning and light

Auto flyups are disabled during auto TF when any of the following occur:
e Ground speed falls below 360 knots

e Drift angle exceeds 10°

e Climb angle exceeds 40°

e Bank angle exceeds 75°

Cues relating to exceeding these arming envelope parameters are:
e TF FAIL - Voice warning and light

e UNARMED/NO ATF light (RCP)

e UNARMED display warning

e “BINK-BINK’ (After higher priority aural warnings)

Manual TF & Flyups - Armed

In manual TF, within the 75° bank limit, auto flyups are generated by the
same conditions as ATF (TF LOW, OBSTACLE or G-LIMIT, or TF FAIL
for component failure). In armed manual, a dive angle greater than 15°
will generate a flyup after 3 seconds.

When bank exceeds 75°, no auto flyup is available; however, a TF pitch
steering display is provided up to 85° bank angle for:

e TF LOW
e OBSTACLE or G-LIMIT

No flyup is available below 360 knots GS when drift is greater than 10° or
climb angle is greater than 40°. The cues for the aircrew are the same as
with ATF.

Manual TF & Flyups - Unarmed

Flyups are indicated through TF pitch steering commands on the relevant
displays. The crew is responsible for performing the appropriate
maneuver.

The criteria for the flyup command are the same as manual TF armed.

The UNARMED/NO ATF light is illuminated (RCP) because the TF flyup
enable switch is off (or the paddle switch is held depressed).

When transitioning to manual TF (MTF) by depressing the paddle switch,
the system reverts to unarmed MTF with no automatic flyup protection.
When transitioning to MTF as a result of exceeding pitch breakout force
or by placing the TF couple switch OFF, flyup protection is available only
if the flyup enable switch is ON.

LAN-6 D-14


Text from LAN-6_TFR_Capabilities_page_21.jpeg:
Flyup Modes

Flyup modes are dependent on the cause or malfunction that precipitates
the maneuver. There are three modes.

Mode A - A Mode A flyup commands an incremental 2 or 3 G pull-up (auto
or manual) to an approximate 20° climb. A TF system component failure
(TF FAIL) commands an incremental 2 G Mode A flyup to 20°. Tripping
the low altitude (TF LOW), OBSTACLE or G-LIMIT warning monitors
commands a constant 3 G incremental flyup. This flyup will continue
until the monitor is no longer tripped, at which time the flyup transitions
to a Mode A flyup to a 20° climb. In armed TF, the aircraft rolls wings
level.

Mode B1 - A Mode B1 flyup is a constant and continuous incremental 2 to
3 G pull-up until a pitch attitude of +40° is reached. FLYUP is displayed
on the HUD, ADI, and TF display. The Mode B1 flyup occurs if there has
been a failure in the INS or its data transmission to the FCC. In armed
TF, the aircraft rolls wings level.

Mode B2 - A Mode B2 flyup is provided by the hydromechanical system if
the pitch CAS disengages during armed TF. The control stick is trimmed
aft to command an incremental 1 G and the PTC drives a stabilator
nose-up command which provides an incremental 2 G command and fades
to 0 G incremental in approximately 7 seconds. No roll compensation is
commanded in this flyup.

In both B1 and B2 flyups, the TF incremental G command trails off at
+40° pitch or after 7 seconds, respectively. However, since the flight
controls have been trimmed to the pitch up position the aircraft will
continue through a loop unless you take control of the aircraft and recover.


Text from LAN-6_TFR_Capabilities_page_22.jpeg:
NOTE

After a Mode B2 flyup, it may be necessary to retrim the aircraft within
the +0.5 G pitch trim limits before reengaging armed TF.

WARNING

The constant G Mode B1 and B2 flyup
will continue into a loop if allowed to
continue. The aircrew must make the
necessary recovery.

Flyup Bottom Line

Regardless of the flyup mode, the pilot is responsible for taking control of
the aircraft, ensuring a 20° wings level climb to MSA, and then analyzing
the problem. When FLYUP is displayed, the pitch command box or bar is
indicating a climb, or warning cues are present, climb immediately. Do
not dwell in diagnostics. Once at MSA, if the cause for the flyup is
unknown you can call up the AFCS detail BIT page to determine the
cause. The cause will be listed under “AUTOPILOT/TF STATUS” on page
one of the AFCS detail status page.

Flyup Termination (Auto and Armed Manual)
If a flyup is initiated, depressing the paddle switch terminates AFCS

inputs to the TF generated commands, reverting the system to unarmed
manual while the switch is held depressed.

TFR MODE DESCRIPTIONS
NORM

NORM (Figure D-1) is the most commonly used TFR mode. It has some
limited ECCM capability and can be used at set clearances (SCs) from
200-1000 feet. It generates climb/dive commands on terrain out to 6 nm.
NORM permits turn rates up to 5.5°/second or about 60° of bank at
normal low level speeds. The F-15E’s maximum bank angle during TF
operations, however, is 60°. The allowable bank angle is reduced to less
than 60° during left turns due to fuselage masking of the NAV pod. The
TF radar’s sensitivity in the NORM mode provides excellent detection of
obstacles with small radar reflectivity such as radio antennas and towers.
NORM should be used whenever possible, particularly when approaching
a turn point (to increase turn capability) and in rugged terrain.

Text from LAN-6_TFR_Capabilities_page_8.jpeg:
wx

The weather (WX1/WX2) modes use circular polarization to provide TF
capability while operating in the rain. The TFR climb/dive range is
reduced to 15,000 feet and the vertical scan limit is reduced to +5° to
decrease the likelihood of commanding on rain showers above the aircraft
(Figure D-2). On the TF display, synthetic video is only displayed out to
2.5 nm, reflecting the reduced command range. As a result, the WX mode
has degraded peak height capabilities when approaching very steep
terrain. Ride and frequency selections are the same as NORM. SC
selections of WX1 are 200-1000 feet. For WX2, SC selections are limited
to 500 and/or 1000 feet.

Figure D - 2. WX Mode TF Radar vs NORM TF Radar.

If the TF display shows returns like those on the left in Figure D-3, select
the WX1 mode for up to light to moderate rain and WX2 for heavier
precipitation and observe the returns. If they disappear from the scope,
low level flight along the planned route may be continued. However,
continue to monitor the TF display, since the moisture reflects more
energy the closer it gets, and the returns may reappear and cause an
OBSTACLE warning and a climb command.

If weather returns cannot be removed by selecting the WX1 or WX2 mode,
the crew must either circumnavigate the weather or climb to the
minimum safe altitude (MSA). DO NOT ignore a climb or flyup command
due to weather, since the clouds may be masking actual terrain from the
TFR. Use caution and consider surrounding terrain and flight path before
selecting WX.
