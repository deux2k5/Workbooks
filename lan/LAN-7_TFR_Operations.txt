Text from LAN-7_TFR_Operations_page_10.jpeg:
e If an autopilot steer mode is engaged prior to coupling the ATF
(A/P - ALT/NAV), the steer mode remains engaged after ATF
coupling (A/P - TF/NAV).

e The green A/P light illuminates when a steer mode is engaged in
ATF. In ATF, the autopilot commands a bank angle up to bank
angle caret limits. These bank angle limits will vary with the
selection of different modes (NORM, LPI, VLC) and different set
clearances.

e In the NAV MM with NAV autopilot steering engaged, the autopilot
flies the aircraft to the LOS point and turns to the following SP
upon auto sequencing.

e In the A/G MM, with no designated target and NAV autopilot
steering engaged, the aircraft flies to the current LOS point and
turns to the following SP upon auto sequencing.

e In the A/G MM, with a designated target and NAV autopilot
steering engaged, the aircraft flies to a wind-corrected weapon
release point or to the target, depending on the selected delivery
mode and weapon (Table D-1).

Auto TF Disengagement

Accomplishment of any of the following actions will disengage auto TF.
e TF couple switch - OFF.
® TF power switch to STBY or OFF.

e Depress and hold the paddle switch. This action reverts TF to
unarmed manual, interrupts but does not disengage basic autopilot
and disengages any steer mode.

e Stick inputs (without depressing the paddle switch) in excess of
4.5 lbs forward or 10.6 lbs aft disengage auto TF. This action
should only be taken as an emergency procedure, due to the induced
trim errors that may result.

NOTE

ATF disengagement via exceedance of pitch stick force limits also
illuminates the MASTER CAUTION light, FLT CONTR caution light
and the MPD/MPCD AUTO PLT caution light. Once back inside TF

parameters you must paddle and release to reenter ATF. Retrimming
the aircraft may be required before reengagement of ATF.

Bottom Line

When the requirement arises to interrupt ATF to maneuver in pitch, (e.g.,
threat reaction or weapon delivery), decouple ATF if time allows; if not,

e pull aft on the control stick and climb to MSA or above. (Do not
depress and hold the paddle switch until at or above MSA.)

® remain above MSA until manual/auto TF reestablished.
e accomplish the maneuver.
e release the paddle switch upon reestablishing TF.

e reengage steer mode with the A/P button as required.

LAN-7 D-6


Text from LAN-7_TFR_Operations_page_13.jpeg:
Recovery from maneuvering requires stabilization within TF limits for 1-3
seconds in NORM, WX and ECCM modes, and 0.5-1.0 seconds in VLC and
LPI. It is unnecessary to interrupt ATF to maneuver in roll within TF
limits. Control stick steering will allow you to change the aircraft heading
by interrupting the engaged steer mode while leaving the autopilot
altitude hold engaged. However, operating outside of TF roll limits for
greater than 2 seconds will result in a Mode A flyup. Anytime the paddle
switch is held depressed, flyup protection is disabled.

Blended Mode

Blended mode involves the coupling of ATF to the altitude hold mode of
the autopilot and allows the aircraft to fly a higher BARO/RDR altitude
and still maintain TF protection. Blended mode maintains the current
BARO or radar altitude until the TF system determines that positive
incremental Gs are required to maintain the selected TF set clearance.
Once the terrain has been cleared using ATF, the aircraft recaptures the
desired BARO or radar altitude (Figure D-3). In blended mode, the bank
angle caret limits look the same as they do in auto/manual TF (45° left
and 60° right in normal mode). However, the autopilot roll limit will only
allow +41.5° bank in the NAV steer mode and +30° bank in the TCN steer
mode. Blended mode is engaged from either the altitude hold mode of the
autopilot or from ATF.

Mode Engagement from Altitude Hold

While in autopilot altitude hold, engage blended mode by placing the TF
switch to ON and the TF couple switch to COUPLE within 4 seconds. If
the TF COUPLE switch is NOT set to COUPLE within 4 seconds, MTF
occurs and the autopilot altitude hold function is disengaged. You can
also enter blended mode by selecting TF COUPLE first then turning the
TF radar switch to ON. If all conditions for initiating ATF are satisfied,
blended mode becomes active.

Mode Engagement from ATF

To engage blended mode from ATF use the UFC A/P submenu. While
holding the paddle switch depressed, press ALT TF (PB #8) on the A/P
submenu. Then fly the aircraft to the desired altitude and release the
paddle switch. Blended mode is engaged at the BARO or radar altitude
established when the paddle switch is released. The A/P TF designation
then changes to A/P BATF or A/P RATF (Figure D-4).

Blended Mode Display Changes

If the altitude hold A/P is in control of blended mode, the ATF pitch bar is
dashed and the NO TERRAIN caution is inhibited on the HUD and EADI.
When the ATF is in control (ATF maintaining terrain clearance), the ATF
pitchbar is solid and the NO TERRAIN caution is active. The green A/P
indicator light illuminates in each cockpit when blended mode is engaged.
PB #9 on the UFC Menu 1 and the top line of the A/P submenu display
either BATF (barometric altitude) as the altitude source or RATF (radar
altitude) as the altitude source (Figure D-4).

Soft ride is always commanded in blended mode because TF performance
is better in the transition from ATF to altitude hold. If selected before or
during blended mode, hard ride will not be implemented until exit from
blended mode.

Blended Mode Disengagement

There are four options for disengaging blended mode.

e Paddle switch depress. This removes the altitude hold and steer
mode engaged portion and puts the aircraft in unarmed manual TF.
When the paddle switch is released, the aircraft reverts to ATF. If
PB #8 on the A/P submenu is reselected before the paddle switch is
released, the blended mode reengages at the new altitude where the
paddle switch is released.

e A/P submenu PB #3. Pressing (deselecting) PB #3 results in exiting
blended mode and returning to ATF. Toggling PB #4 between RDR
and BARO changes the altitude source, but does not, of itself,
disengage blended mode.

e TF couple OFF. This disengages both altitude hold and steer mode,
and results in MTF.

e TF radar switch STBY or OFF. This disengages all TF and A/P
modes. The pilot must fly the aircraft.



Text from LAN-7_TFR_Operations_page_16.jpeg:
Expanded Blended Mode

The blended altitude/TF mode has been expanded to allow engagement of
the altitude select autopilot mode capability. Performance is the same as
blended mode, with the addition of a smooth transition from one altitude
to another by entering the new altitude into the altitude select on the A/P
submenu. Altitudes between 1000 feet and 50,000 feet can be selected.
You must be between 360 knots ground speed and .97 mach. When the
newly selected altitude is achieved, the aircraft will transition to the
blended mode.

Mode Engagement from Blended Mode

The expanded mode is most easily entered from blended mode. While in
blended mode select the autopilot submenu on the UFC. Type the desired
altitude into the scratchpad and enter it by pressing PB #8 (Figure D-5).
This action initiates the mode and the aircraft starts the appropriate
climb or descent.

To engage the expanded blended mode, the aircrew must first engage the
TF capability. Move the TF couple switch to the COUPLE position and
move the TF RDR switch from STBY to ON. During the 4 second

paddle switch (CSO). While held, the UFC autopilot menu displays the
blended mode selections. Press PB #38, which selects blended mode, enter
requested altitude in the scratchpad and transfer to PB #8 (which adds
the altitude selection), then release the paddle switch. The aircraft will
begin the appropriate climb or descent.

Mode Failures and Indications

Prior to the Suite 3 change, the aircrew had no indication of why an
autopilot/TF event occurred. Since causes for these events include both
system failures (not directly under pilot control) and limit exceedances
(initiated by pilot action), knowing the cause allows the pilot to take the
appropriate corrective action.

Both the cause and/or existing functional failure are displayed on the
STATUS page under AFCS DETAIL under BIT. When weight is off
wheels, DETAIL defaults to the STATUS page (Figure D-8) with
maintenance faults available by selecting FAULTS at PB #13. With
weight on wheels, the display will default to FAULTS with STATUS

OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
Mission Planning

TF operations suggest that a surreptitious entry and exit from an area is
desired. Therefore, be well acquainted with the terrain you will fly over.
Plan your route to provide terrain masking and avoid high ridge crossings
and man-made objects like power lines and towers. Recognize the
potential no-show areas such as sand dunes, snow covered peaks, dry
lakes and bodies of water. Plan the use of clearance plane settings
commensurate with the threat and the terrain.

Weather may degrade NAV FLIR resolution and require WX1 or WX2
mode for continued TF flight. Remember peak height restrictions for the
WX and ECCM modes. If you are heavy, you may consider routing
through less rugged terrain and avoid deep valleys and steep ridges. Keep
minimum speeds in mind. Have a solid route abort plan for each segment
of your TF flight. Determine appropriate MSA for combat and training.
Recognize reduced bank angles due to fuselage masking. Know who to
talk to and what to squawk if you exit a route. Review the Dash 34-1-1 for
additional mission planning considerations.

Ground Operations

You must thoroughly check all LANTIRN components and associated
systems prior to takeoff.

After the TFR and NAV FLIR have timed in (TF STBY and N/F STBY on
UFC Menu 1), run an AIU (or auto) BIT, then run the LANT/RALT BIT.
Running the BIT before both systems have timed in (or with one system
OFF) may produce false failure indications. After the BIT, have the crew
chief check the NAV pod BIT indicators to see if any components have
failed, and if so, start another BIT and call for a “redball.” If a specialist
asks you to cycle the power on the pod, turn both the TFR and NAV FLIR
to OFF and allow one minute in OFF before returning to STBY.

This prevents a power surge, which may trip circuit breakers in both the
aircraft and pod. The TFR will require an additional 3 minutes to time in.

Before takeoff, check the BIT page for any faults in the TF RDR, NAV

FLIR, AFCS, RALT (radar altimeter), AIU, INS, ADC and MPDP. Each
of these systems plays an important role in TF operations.

LAN-7 D-16


Text from LAN-7_TFR_Operations_page_23.jpeg:
Airborne Operations

Prior to TF operations, perform a confidence check of the TFR system [AW
the Dash 1 and Dash 34-1-1. Before low level operations, accomplish as
many cockpit administrative tasks as possible. Changing radio
frequencies, A/A 'TACAN, selecting displays or arranging your kneeboard
paperwork are a few tasks not appropriate during a TF descent.

Both crew members should pay special attention to verifying that their
standby attitude indicators are properly set. Periodically cross-check the
standby attitude indicator throughout the flight so that if an MPDP fails
during night TFR operations, the standby instruments can be used during
the flyup.

TFR Requirements

AFI 11-2F-15E, Volume 3 and 4FW Supplement, Chapter 8 lists TFR
requirements as follows:

e > 400 KCAS in mountainous terrain

e Night — avoid let-downs into rugged terrain

e TFR not authorized until confidence check is complete
e If any part of the confidence check or any component fails,
abort or fly at MSA/RAA

e Operating outside TF limits below MSA is not authorized
e Pilots — no heads down sensor operations outside TF limits

e TF malfunctions — climb to MSA/RAA, clear malfunctions
and then continue


Text from LAN-7_TFR_Operations_page_24.jpeg:
e Minimum equipment:

TF radar

E-scope

INS

CARA/radar altimeter

Maximum of one failed display per cockpit

HUD and MPCD required in FCP

No unarmed manual TF

TF Descent

The initial descent is normally accomplished to 1000 feet SC. Both crew
members should monitor the TF display during the descent. Some rules of
thumb for a let-down from medium altitude to 1000 feet SC, over level
terrain include:

@® max commanded dive is 12°.

e TF video at 1 nm mark passing 2600 feet AGL (12° dive, 480 GS)
(2000' + %2 dive angle x 100’).

e = pullout/level off begins not later than 1600 feet AGL
(12° dive, 480 GS) (1000' + 2 dive angle x 100’).

e descend over level terrain if possible and cross-check MSL altitudes
against radar altitudes.

In some cases, the TF let-down is accomplished from a VFR departure at
lower altitudes (i.e., 4500 feet AGL). In this case, a full dive does not
occur, but the crew should verify that the pullout occurs when video
returns reach the ZCL. In either case, planned recovery initiation altitude
(RIA) should be established to allow for a wings level recovery at MSA
should TF protection be lost during the descent.

Low Level Navigation

The TSD provides a great deal of situational awareness for TFR. It
provides a cross-check of aircraft position versus courseline, permits
anticipation of turns and helps in selecting a route of flight that optimizes
terrain masking. Look for valleys and ridgelines on the TSD and compare
them to what appears through the NAV FLIR and on the E-scope. The
TSD should have a 45° bank angle and 480 knots set for the course line
reference.

Occasionally exceeding TF limits is inevitable, but the crew should take
immediate action to correct the situation. Usually this means reducing
the bank angle. For an OBST caution in the direction of turn, roll wings
level until the OBST caution is removed, then resume the turn.

Operating Limitations
The following are Dash 1, Chapter 5 limitations.

e Minimum SC for manual TF in mountainous terrain in IMC is 500
feet. Mountainous terrain is defined as a vertical change which
equates to a 15% slope change.

e Terrain following is prohibited with a degraded INS attitude
platform or TF attitude fail or after performing an in-flight
alignment.

e Airspeed should be maintained above 370 KCAS and 400 knots GS
to avoid TF algorithm inaccuracies. TF operations above 0.96 mach
(650 knots GS) are prohibited. LANTIRN operations above 0.9
mach may cause overheating of both pods. A NAV POD HOT or
TGT POD HOT caution may indicate that the pod is being flown
outside its environmental limitations.

e Refer to Aircraft Operating Envelope With Single (Both) LANTIRN
Pod(s) Installed for airspeed limits with one or both pods installed.


Text from LAN-7_TFR_Operations_page_34.jpeg:
CREW COORDINATION

Good crew coordination is essential during all phases of flight, but it is
particularly critical for night TFR. The techniques discussed here are
merely a foundation. Every crew member must develop his own habit
patterns and cover them in the crew briefing. Know what to expect from
the other crew member before stepping to the aircraft.

Pilot

The pilot’s primary responsibility is flying the aircraft. In manual TFR,
this means keeping the velocity vector in or above the TF steering box and
staying within bank limits. All other tasks are secondary, especially at
night when visual cues are limited.

The pilot usually has responsibility for navigation, using the TSD and
NAV FLIR to select the best route of flight for terrain masking. However,
if the WSO needs to make an HRM map the pilot may need to fly a
particular path through the hills, so cross talk is essential.

During auto TF, the pilot task loading is significantly changed and he can
shift some attention to other tasks. Threat analysis, E-scope
interpretation and assisting the WSO are options in auto TF that were not
available during manual TF, but the pilot is still responsible for “flying”
the aircraft, using ATF to reduce workload.

WSO

The WSO’s primary responsibility is sensor operation (A/G radar, A/A
radar, TGT IR). Whenever possible, the WSO should perform cockpit
duties such as radio changes, IFF/AAI changes and other UFC operations.
This reduces task loading on the pilot and permits the pilot to concentrate
on the primary task. The WSO also backs up the pilot by monitoring the
TF E-scope and the HUD repeater. During some phases of flight, the
WSO may wish to use RBM to provide an additional sensor for terrain
avoidance (for example, in areas of reduced FLIR visibility or approaching
a coastline with rapidly rising terrain) or to locate weather cells for
avoidance.

Pilot and WSO

Either crew member can make changes to TF mode, SC or ride selection;
however, always coordinate with the other crew member before changing
something that will affect the aircraft’s flight path. Sometimes changing
one system affects another. For example, when descending to a lower SC,
it is important to reset the LAWS to avoid an unwanted LOW ALTITUDE
warning.

Some failures demand your attention. For instance, TF FAIL and FLYUP
may accompany a BIT failure. Both crew members should make certain
the aircraft is level and at a safe altitude before initiating any BITs. If an
AV BIT caution light occurs during TF flight, a crew member (usually the
WSO) should select a BIT display to see if the failure involves a LANTIRN
component or associated system.

During the attack phase of the mission, both crew members face an
increase in task loading. The WSO is often busy with radar work, and
during the delivery, the pilot may be required to devote more attention to
acquiring the target in the NAV FLIR. To avoid task saturation, a good
understanding of each other’s duties is vital. Prior to a maneuvering
attack, such as a loft, each crew member should select an ADI display,
verify standby ADI operation and confirm that the other crew member has
done so as well. At least one crew member (again, usually the WSO)
should monitor a TF display during the attack and recovery maneuver.
Verbally confirm such parameters as pull-down altitude, release altitude,
MSA and egress heading.

The LANTIRN system provides the F-15E with a tremendous increase in
versatility, but it places high demands on the crew. Only by developing
effective crew coordination techniques can the system’s full capability be
realized.

TEXT
MANUAL, AUTO AND BLENDED TF OPERATIONS
Manual TF

Manual TF operations require the pilot, through flight control input, to
maintain the desired terrain clearance by keeping the velocity vector in
the TF “box.” Further, the pilot is responsible to stay within the TF limits
covered in previous lessons. Small deviations during manual TF
operation are to be expected, but constant attention must be dedicated to
following climb and dive commands and remaining within TF limits.

Armed Manual

The pilot maintains terrain clearance and the aircraft within TF limits by
following the TF “box” climb and dive commands. Auto flyup protection is
provided in that should any flyup commands occur due to component
failure or obstacles in your flight path, the command is sent directly to the
flight controls and the flyup is accomplished without pilot input.

Unarmed Manual

Unarmed manual is the same as armed manual, but auto flyup protection
is not provided and the pilot must accomplish any commanded flyup. The
use of unarmed manual TF has been largely restricted by Higher

Headquarters. The use of either TF mode in IMC conditions is prohibited.

Manual with Radar Altimeter in Override

Manual pilot inputs are required to maintain TF limits and terrain
clearance. If the tactical situation dictates TF with a failed or jammed
radar altimeter, placing the radar altimeter in override will allow manual
TF operation. The radar altimeter will be off and safety features and
warnings provided by the FCC low altitude monitors are removed. There
is no peacetime situation to warrant flying manual TF with the radar
altimeter in override.

LAN-7

WARNING

If MTF is conducted with the radar
altimeter switch in OVERRIDE, all TF
low altitude flyup and low altitude
warning functions are inoperative. The
TF flyup enable switch must be placed in
the OFF position; otherwise, a TF FAIL
condition will exist and the crew will
experience continual flyups. Over
rolling/rough terrain it is possible to cross
ridges significantly lower than the SC.

CAUTION

If the radar altimeter switch is in
OVERRIDE, the LAW function must be
turned off (UFC Menu 1) to avoid
activation of the low altitude voice
warning and warning light.


Text from LAN-7_TFR_Operations_page_9.jpeg:
Auto TF

Placing the TF couple switch to COUPLE initiates auto TF operations.
This coupling of the TF system to AFCS and the autopilot enables the
crew to terrain follow and navigate almost “hands off.”

e When initially coupling TF with no steer mode previously engaged,
only the “basic” autopilot attitude hold is engaged to the TF radar.

e If you have greater than 7° bank, the system will maintain
the bank angle at engagement until a steer mode is engaged
or the aircrew makes manual steering inputs.

e If you have less than 7° bank, the system will maintain
wings level at engagement until a steer mode is engaged or
the aircrew makes manual steering inputs.

° A steer mode may be engaged after coupling by either
selecting it via PB #3 on the autopilot submenu on the UFC
or by depressing the A/P button on the UFC.

NOTE

In auto TF rolling outside of TF limits for greater than 2 seconds will
result in a flyup. You must return to within TF limits, then paddle
and release to discontinue the flyup and reenter auto TF.

If bank angle is between the bank angle carets and 60° (turn
rate caution) you will get an auto FLYUP and TF FAIL until

returning to within limits and paddle and release.

If bank angle is between 60 and 75 degrees (roll caution) you

will get an auto FLYUP and TF FAIL until returning to within
limits and paddle and release.

If bank angle is between 75 and 85 degrees you will get a
“bink-bink” tone, TF FAIL, MASTER CAUTION light,
UNARMED/NO ATF light and an AUTOPILOT caution on the
MPD/MPCD the associated FLYUP commands displayed on the
HUD/MPD/MPCDs must be manually accomplished until you
return to within limits and paddle and release. At more than 75
degrees of bank you are outside of the auto flyup envelope.
