AIR COMBAT COMMAND


Text from OPS-1_Task_Management-Crew_Coordination_page_10.jpeg:
Formation

The pilot maintains aircraft position/control and visual lookout (route and
tactical formations).

The WSO maintains visual lookout, operates/monitors radar, changes
UFC data, operates the navigation systems, and monitors the formation
position. (At low altitude—300 ft and below—the WSO is primary for
formation.)

Instruments

The pilot confirms that an EADI and other appropriate instruments are
displayed prior to entering IFR conditions or beginning instrument flight.
Then, the pilot flies the appropriate route, fix-to-fix, holding pattern, or
approach.

The WSO monitors and advises on critical positions/attitudes and/or
altitudes. The WSO monitors the present position, heading, altitude, and
can “bug” GCA assigned headings using CMD HDG on the HSI and set
the desired course. The WSO also changes radio frequencies, navigation
aids, and HSI steer modes unless briefed otherwise.

Air-to-Air Employment

The WSO is normally the primary air-to-air radar operator until the sort.
The crew may want to change this based on crew experience, proficiency,
and the anticipated specifics of the mission (especially with Suite 3). The
assigned primary radar operator takes command of the radar, conducts
search and sort, and locks on to the target. Normally, whoever has control
of the radar also talks on the radio.

If the pilot is not the primary radar operator, he flies the aircraft as
required or directed. If the pilot is running the radar, he advises the WSO
of their actions.

Both the pilot and WSO should ensure the EID criteria are met using
AAI/EID/NCTR as applicable. The WSO ensures the weapons
employment checklist is completed and monitors weapons status on the
PACS.

OPS-1 D-4


Text from OPS-1_Task_Management-Crew_Coordination_page_11.jpeg:
As a general rule, no later than 10 nm (or at a briefed/predetermined
time), the pilot takes command of the radar (to ensure auto acquisition
capabilities at the merge), flies to the weapons employment position, and
employs the weapons. With the transfer of the radar to the pilot, the
WSO takes over the visual lookout responsibilities. The pilot owns the
radios at radar handoff and should inform the wingman/lead of any
changes due to target maneuvering.

Air-to-Surface Employment

Low Level

The pilot flies the low level using all available means to maintain
situational awareness on the route of flight and terrain clearance (i.e.,
visual references, HUD, TSD, TEWS, TFR, and/or NAV FLIR
presentations). When directed by the WSO, the pilot flies a mapping leg
to attain the desired squint angle for A/G radar employment.

The WSO generally performs all of the head-in-the-cockpit functions. The
WSO operates the radar, monitors TEWS and the TF scope, and backs up
HUD steering with TSD/HSI. The WSO also monitors INS/MN accuracy
with A/G radar, performs updates as required, and is responsible for route
timing. The WSO will direct a mapping leg if required.

FLIR Operations

With the LANTIRN NAV pod, the pilot turns on the NAV FLIR and
advises the WSO when he is using snap look or look-into-turn. The pilot
also confirms manual/auto TFR, advises the WSO of any changes to
clearance planes/TF modes, and confirms that the aircraft is within TFR
limits after a dive or climb when auto is reengaged.

The WSO monitors the HUD display and TFR scope (E-scope), and
changes the LAWS when requested by the pilot or dictated by mission
requirements.

With the LANTIRN targeting IR pod, the WSO turns on, boresights, and
operates the targeting IR pod in all normal circumstances. The WSO cues
it with the A/A radar, A/G radar, or TSD, updates, lases as appropriate,
and deselects the laser. The pilot confirms that the laser has been
deselected by referencing the HUD and confirming verbally.

OPS-1


Text from OPS-1_Task_Management-Crew_Coordination_page_12.jpeg:
IP to Target

The pilot should remain in the A/A master mode until the target area is
clear of all air threats, and then go to A/G master mode. For timing, the
pilot can reference the command velocity wiper in the HUD or the ETA on
the DATA 2 page for timing to the IP or target.

Once in the A/G master mode, the pilot follows attack steering while
monitoring the target area and TEWS for possible A/G or A/A threats.

The pilot is responsible for turning on the master arm IAW the tactical
situation or local area range restrictions. The pilot executes the planned
delivery and egresses the area (or enters range pattern). The WSO selects
PACS, and confirms the program selected and that weapons are ready.
The WSO prepares for target acquisition using TSD, A/G radar, and
targeting IR.

The WSO designates the target using the best means available (TGT
POD, HRM, RBM, NAV, etc.). The WSO confirms that A/G master mode
is selected, good steering is available, and master arm is on and RDY
lights are present; and then monitors the delivery parameters.

Threat Reactions

The crew must clearly distribute threat reaction tasks to effectively
employ the F-15E in a high threat environment. Many aircrews divide
this objective into an offensive and defensive partnership, giving the pilot
primary responsibility for the offensive portion, since the pilot “owns” the
visual arena. The pilot is alternately responsible for defense.

In this case, the WSO’s primary responsibility is defense, since so much of
his time is spent “checking six.” The WSO also provides backup for
offense.

The use and coordination of the countermeasures (CMD) chaff/flares must

also be coordinated to ensure they are being employed when needed and
that both aircrew members are not dispensing them at the same time.

OPS-1 D-6


Text from OPS-1_Task_Management-Crew_Coordination_page_13.jpeg:
Crew Coordination During Emergency Procedures

Good crew coordination during any aircraft emergency is imperative. It
can be the difference between the successful recovery of a crippled aircraft
or a Class A mishap with two fatalities. As always, good crew
coordination starts with a thorough crew brief. Crew coordination briefing
guides are available in the flying squadron flight briefing guides, but may
need to be tailored to accommodate aircrew experience and personal
techniques. The three basic steps to any emergency procedure still apply:

1. Maintain aircraft control
2. Analyze the situation and take the proper action
3. Land as soon as practicable

At a minimum, you need to cover your plans of action for:

AMAD/engine fire during start
Engine fire on takeoff

Blown tire on takeoff

Aborted takeoff
Ejection/command selector valve
Brake failure

Ground egress

Bird strikes/structural damage
Barrier engagement

It is the responsibility of BOTH aircrew members to ensure the safe
operation and successful recovery of their aircraft. The following
information outlines general aircrew considerations.

Pilot

The pilot-in-command must always maintain aircraft control during any
abnormal situation. There are currently no “boldface” procedures
associated with the F-15E because there are very few emergencies that
require immediate action. The pilot and the WSO must quickly “analyze
the situation and then take the appropriate actions. The WSO refers to
the checklist and backs the pilot up in assessing the problem. Once the
problem has been correctly assessed, the appropriate checklist actions
should be accomplished with the WSO backing up actions taken by the
pilot (i.e., effective crew coordination). In time critical emergencies, such
as a high speed abort, the pilot is responsible for accomplishing the first
few steps of the emergency procedure. The pilot must also keep the WSO
advised of the steps already taken to control the situation and then the
WSO will follow up with the appropriate checklist.

D-7 OPS-1


Text from OPS-1_Task_Management-Crew_Coordination_page_14.jpeg:
WSO

The task of the WSO during an abnormal situation is to refer to the
checklist to ensure the appropriate steps are being taken. The WSO reads
all appropriate checklists (both emergency and normal checklists) when
time and conditions permit. In short, the WSO feeds the pilot the
information needed to safely recover the aircraft. In some instances, the
WSO may accomplish some of the checklist items like lowering the hook or
pulling the emergency brake/steer handle after coordinating with the
pilot. In many cases, the WSO is also the one who informs others of the
situation.

Responsibilities of Both

It is the responsibility of both the pilot and WSO to maintain situational
awareness (SA). In addition to aircraft status, crew members must know
the distance to and status of their primary landing base. They must know
when, where, and how to jettison ordnance/stores from their aircraft. And
most importantly, they must know when to “jettison” the aircraft. Though
the pilot-in-command is ultimately responsible for this decision, as a crew
they must discuss and agree to the decision to eject, unless there is not
enough time for crew coordination.

DISPLAY PROGRAMMING AND SETUP

The final setup in each cockpit still depends on crew preference. A great
deal of coordination is necessary to effectively program and set up F-15E
displays. Here are possible display alignments for each cockpit.

Pilot
LMPD MPCD RMPD
A/A RDR TSD TEWS/HSI
A/G RDR ARMT TGT IR
TF RDR HSI BIT/ADI

(An ADI is not programmed because it always comes up on the FCP
MPCD with first activation of the FCP castle switch.) LMPD/RMPD could
be considered mission critical displays.

WSO
LMPCD LMPD RMPD RMPCD
TF RDR HUD A/ARDR TEWS
TSD TGT IR A/GRDR_ HSI
ARMT BIT TGT IR ADI

The WSO should have engine instruments displayed for takeoff selected
via menu. LMPD/RMPD could be considered mission critical displays.

Master Modes

Since desired presentations can be programmed to automatically come up
when A/A, A/G, or NAV master mode is selected (INST master mode is a
preset standard and cannot be programmed), the following is a possible
master mode alignment that may be used subject to unit/crew preference.

Pilot
M/M LMPD MPCD RMPD
A/G A/GRDR ARMT
NAV A/ARDR  TSD

You may prefer not to program a master mode, since the pilot controls
master mode changes which could cause RCP displays to change without
warning. If you do program, here are suggested alignments:

SITUATIONAL AWARENESS (SA)

If one has all of these qualities and can perform all of these tasks, that
individual has SA.

e Building a 3D picture in your mind of the entire situation.

e Assimilation of information from multiple sources (visual, auditory,
kinesthetic, balance).

e Knowing spatial position and geometric relationships of yourself and
the things in the environment around you.

e = Periodically updating the current situation (this is normally done
through communication).

e Prioritizing information and actions (what to attend to at the
cognitive level and what to do at the subconscious level).

e Making quality and timely decisions.

e Projecting the current situation into the future (anticipating,
predicting, and basing actions on upcoming events).

SA usually falls into the four categories listed below:

Both crew members have total SA - best.

One crew member has good SA - good.

Neither has SA - bad.

Neither has SA but one thinks he does - worse.

The key to keeping SA on the positive side of the scale is effective crew
coordination. Effective crew coordination starts with intercockpit
communication which must be clear, concise, and necessary. Unnecessary
chitchat in the cockpit is a distraction to the task at hand, and is a key
contribution to the loss of SA.

What Is A Loss Of SA?

A loss of SA occurs when cockpit distractions and/or responsibilities cause
a breakdown in the prioritization of information, resulting in a temporary
failure to properly assess available information and initiate required
aircrew actions. This can lead to disaster.

A breakdown of SA normally occurs in at least one of four areas:
distraction, inattention, channelized attention, or complacency.
Awareness describes one’s ability to acquire and maintain situational
awareness. It demands attention and implies a grasp of the overall
situation, an ability to stay on top of things, or an ability to control the
situation. In the air-to-air arena of fighter aviation, this may mean
keeping track of different groups of bandits at different locations in front

D-15

OPS-1


Text from OPS-1_Task_Management-Crew_Coordination_page_22.jpeg:
of and behind you. One must listen to auditory inputs from intercockpit,
interflight from the wingman, AWACS, and different warning tones from
the radars of the bandits locking onto your aircraft, or warning messages
from the voice warning system in the aircraft. Fighter pilots must be able
to compartmentalize to a certain degree, to prioritize tasks, to use
judgment and to decide which perceptual input to deal with right now,
whether visual, auditory, balance, or kinesthetic. Humans can do but one
thing at a time consciously, but can shift very rapidly between inputs or
use habitual behavior to the point where they can accomplish several
tasks apparently at once. Pilots must always remain oriented with the
environment around them, so if the perception of imbalance or vertigo
occurs, the cross-checking of the instruments becomes the main priority.
Inattention to the instruments at this point or channelized attention on
some other task during this critical phase of flight has killed many an
aviator. The records of the National Transportation Safety Board show
that each year roughly 80 percent of aircraft accidents are caused by pilot
error.

How Do I Recognize It?

Staying focused on the task at hand, staying ahead of the aircraft, and
being mentally prepared to fly is the only way to maintain situational
awareness in a changing environment. Occasionally a distracter such as
an aircraft malfunction occurs and your attention and awareness is not
focused on the task at hand. A visual distraction could be a light bulb
burned out, an auditory distraction could be from somebody else in the
aircraft or on the radio, a kinesthetic distraction may be a nose gear
shimmy. All of these alone are no big deal, but they could cause you to
channelize your attention on that distraction. Webster defines
complacency as smug self-satisfaction. To allow ourselves to become smug
and overconfident in our abilities is to invite disaster. Performing
repetitious tasks successfully can lead to complacency. This may give one
the false sense that the job is simplistic or consists of menial tasks without
inherent dangers. Aircrew kill themselves quite often because they forget
the task at hand while thinking about something else. That may or may
not be due to complacency but is certainly due to the failure to consciously
monitor the present task cognitively. When one is flying an aircraft at
500 feet and 500 knots, how can they not stay focused or be thinking of
something else? One must pay attention to the appropriate task, at the
correct time, and at the needed level of consciousness to maintain total
situational awareness.

OPS-1 D-16


Text from OPS-1_Task_Management-Crew_Coordination_page_23.jpeg:
Symptoms

Aircrew need to know their own limitations and how much they can
depend on the attentive capabilities of others. Personalities differ in each
person regarding directions, strength, and scope of attention. It is
important for the individual and those involved in their selection,
training, and employment to measure and recognize these differences.
The most important is a person’s attentiveness to tasks. Some people can
attend to more information than others. Normally, information from only
one sense at a time reaches the level of consciousness, with the other
inputs being censored at the midbrain level. Again, humans can do but
one thing at a time consciously but can shift very rapidly between inputs
or use habitual behavior to the point that they can accomplish several
tasks apparently at once. This is why we say the way to get more SA is to
practice the event often. Repetition of any stimulus reduces the threshold
for attending and thus allows a response to the repeated signal quicker at
the subconscious level.

Some pilots could not describe what they do with the throttles and stick
during most maneuvers. Once one learns a task or a job, much of it is
performed by habit that is not necessarily subject to conscious control or
memory. A familiar process is initiated consciously but continued and
completed by habit, using a different portion of the brain. This frees up
the conscious or cognitive portion of the brain so that one’s attention can
be directed to another task as the previous task is completed by habitual
behavior. Habitual behavior depends upon identical repetition of
circumstances and fails when the situation is not identical. Even if the
ground is level and regular, aircrew can fly into it simply because they did
not know they were losing altitude during a turn. Entering a turn at low
altitude requires that pilots attend exclusively to ground clearance tasks
so they can judge whether they are converging with the ground along the
intended flight path.

Attention is our ability to do more than one task at the same time. We
regard the human as a limited-capacity channel who can only transmit a
small amount of information per second. Whenever this small amount is
exceeded, people make errors. An aircrew member who must process
information that exceeds their individual channel capacity will make
mistakes. There are not many possibilities for increasing the channel
capacity of aircrew, although extensive training may sometimes give the
impression that this happened.

OPS-1


Text from OPS-1_Task_Management-Crew_Coordination_page_24.jpeg:
The most important portion of situational awareness is to attend to things
at a conscious level and then rapidly shift to a subconscious level, so that
another task may be accomplished at the conscious level. One can only
pay attention to one task or process at a time while they are using
habitual attention on the other tasks. Most pilots can hold the aircraft
attitude, altitude, and airspeed constant with rapid shifting while they
actively listen or talk on the radios. If there is a demand for attention to
the aircraft attitude, then the attention for the radio communication will
be broken. When rapid shifting is required, one is susceptible to fatigue
which normally leads to channelized attention, task misprioritization, or
inattention to the required tasks at hand causing a loss of SA.

How To Get More SA

SA skills can be increased easily. By increasing knowledge of tactics and
weapons capabilities, one can stay on top of the tactical situation easier.
The SA skills can be developed and improved by increased flight time in a
realistic multibogey, high threat environment. This is definitely due to
building habit patterns and behaviors so that more tasks can be
accomplished at the subconscious level. When actual training cannot be
done, simulation is the next best thing and networked simulation, as a
supplement to flight time, enables practice scenarios that, for practical
reasons, cannot be done in the air short of war.

If we cannot increase a person’s SA skills, perhaps we can teach the key
indicators to lost or poor SA. The following are the key indicators.

e Reduced frequency and degraded quality of communication
(inside/outside of the aircraft).

e Reduced maneuvering of aircraft or difficulty in aircraft control.

Begins to react defensively rather than offensively.

Channelized attention—becomes fixated on some activity (slow

cross-check).

No reaction to wingman or GCI communication.

Poor premerge kill ratio.

Failure to maintain awareness of mission objectives.

Violations.

Omitting checklist items.

OPS-1 D-18


Text from OPS-1_Task_Management-Crew_Coordination_page_25.jpeg:
Solutions

Some solutions for situational awareness are nothing more than common
sense items. Perhaps above all, if you get into a corner, recognize it,
admit it, and handle it.

Be prepared to fly.

Plan the mission thoroughly.
Brief thoroughly.

Outline clear delineation of duties.
If you have a problem, admit it.

e Handle the problem.

Treat it as an emergency.
Climb to cope if at low level.
Set new priorities.

Tell someone.

Pass control of the aircraft, or engage autopilot, if appropriate.
RTB/abort.

The bottom line is work on more inattention; yes, pay less attention.
Sounds strange doesn’t it? To increase your SA, one must try to increase
their habitual behaviors and to accomplish more tasks at the subconscious
level. Train like you are going to fight and when the time comes, you will
react instinctively, out of habit.

EJECTION SYSTEMS AND THE DECISION TO EJECT
Seat Capabilities

The F-15E is equipped with the ACES II ejection seat. This seat has true
zero-zero capabilities for virtually all boarding weights. The seat system
allows for selection of various single and dual sequenced ejections, based
on the position of the command selector valve and which seat initiated the
ejection. The ejection seats are equipped with a primary and secondary
ejection system along with a canopy breaker system (Figure D-1). These
systems are isolated and independent of each other. Both the primary
and secondary ejection systems are initiated when the ejection control
handles in either cockpit are raised. When the ejection control handles
are raised there is a built-in time delay that will allow the primary system
to operate without having the secondary system interfere with its
operation. If the primary system does not operate within .4 seconds, the
secondary system will fire, jettisoning the canopy and firing the seat
catapults. If both systems fail to jettison the canopy the secondary system
will fire the seat catapults, resulting in through-the-canopy ejection. The
secondary system will fire the seats regardless of canopy position.

The seat restraint system holds the crew member in the seat during the
ejection sequence. Prior to man-seat separation the restraint release
system fires, releasing the lap belts, inertial reel straps, and the seat pan
release. The survival kit seat straps should be positioned so they are snug
but not so tight as to restrict movement.

CAUTION

If the survival kit seat straps are left
loose there is the possibility that
during man-seat separation injury or
entanglement may occur.

Ejection Modes

The ejection seat modes are both airspeed and altitude dependent. During
an ejection, the seat operates in one of three modes also described in
TO 1F-15E-1.

Mode 1

Mode 1 is the slow speed mode (Figure D-3). With the aircraft below
15,000 ft MSL and 250 knots or less (Figure D-5, page D-26) there is a 0.2
second delay between the ejection and the time the main parachute
drogue is deployed. At 0.45 seconds, man-seat separation and parachute
inflation begins. At 1.8 seconds there will be full inflation of the RCP
parachute. The front seat will have full parachute inflation 0.4 seconds
after the RCP due to the delay in a dual sequenced ejection.

Mode 2

Mode 2 is entered when you eject in the region bounded in Figure D-5,
page D-26 by airspeed and altitude. It can be considered your high
airspeed, low altitude ejection mode. In this mode, the seat will fire and
deploy the seat mounted drogue (Figure D-4). The seat mounted drogue is
used to stabilize and slow the seat down, decreasing the possibility of
flailing injuries. This mode will be maintained until the seat decelerates
into the Mode 1 region, at which time the seat drogue chute is released
and the main parachute is deployed. There is a slight increase in the time
it takes to get a fully inflated parachute over a Mode 1 ejection.

NOTE

When comparing the times contained in Figure D-4, the back seat would

add approximately 0.3 seconds for canopy separation and the front seat
should add an additional 0.4 seconds for a dual sequenced ejection.

NOTE
This may be the one time you try to beat the seat. If you pull the

emergency manual chute handle it releases the seat drogue chute and
initiates main parachute deployment and man-seat separation.

WARNING

Pulling the emergency manual chute in
the upper airspeed regions of a Mode 2
or Mode 8 ejection may result in
flailing injuries.

Making the Decision

The ejection decision has to be made in a timely manner to avoid an
out-of-the-envelope ejection. There have been several ejections in the
Strike Eagle. Most have been successful with the crew initiating the
ejection within the envelope. However, there is a least one case where a
very experienced crew failed to initiate an ejection within the envelope
from an aircraft that was in a spin, resulting in two fatalities.

The rules still apply; use 2000 ft AGL for controlled and 6000 ft AGL for
uncontrolled ejection. Once the decision has been made to eject, both crew
members should initiate the ejection sequence by pulling their own control
handles.

GENERAL RESPONSIBILITIES

The F-15E crew coordination requirements are unique and require a mind
set different from any other two-place fighter to fully realize the F-15E’s
state-of-the-art capabilities. Due to its unique cockpit avionics, either
cockpit offers the capability to control most of the aircraft avionics or
sensors thus creating the possibility for confusion in the cockpit during
mission performance. It is therefore imperative to inform the other crew
member when action in one cockpit affects the other cockpit; for example,
when taking command of a display or changing a HSI steer mode. A more
critical example is when the WSO changes the SCP on the TFR without
informing the pilot. This affects the safe operation of the aircraft, not just
the use of a display.

In broad terms, the pilot is responsible for aircrew briefings, aircraft
preflight, aircraft control, weapons deliveries, assigning specific mission
duties, aircraft recovery, aircraft postflight, and aircrew debriefings.

The WSO is responsible for applicable specific mission briefings, weapons
preflight, the input and check of mission data on the UFC, specific duties
as assigned during the aircrew briefing, monitoring aircraft status and
mission progression, target designations, aircraft systems management,
and changing radios and navigation aids, unless briefed otherwise.
Further guidance can be found in MCR 55-115 and local directives.

CREW COORDINATION

Certain systems lend themselves logically to a primary user by virtue of
their function and/or location. Others are not so clear cut and in many
cases full operation can be accomplished from either cockpit. This
discussion identifies the more critical areas and suggests controller/
operator and backup duties.

These duties are not restrictive and should be modified as experience is
gained in the F-15E. Also bear in mind that suggested duties are subject
to modification depending on crew member experience level in certain
missions, unit standardization, and the environment.

OPS-1


Text from OPS-1_Task_Management-Crew_Coordination_page_8.jpeg:
Pilot Duties

The pilot’s primary duty as aircraft commander is to maintain aircraft
control, make critical decisions, and take the appropriate actions to ensure
mission success and aircraft safety. The pilot is responsible for effectively
flying the aircraft to the correct position as required by the particular
mission or tasking. Another pilot responsibility that may be different
from other crew aircraft is navigation to and from the target/mission area.

WSO Duties

The WSO’s primary duty is weapon systems management and operation,
and to act as a “safety observer” to ensure mission success and aircraft
safety. The WSO backs up all basic responsibilities for navigation and is
in charge of operating the INS and inserting/changing data on the UFC to
include the radios, sequence points, navigation aids, and IFF/SIF codes.

Duties of Both
Checklist

The pilot and WSO are responsible for checklist completion for the aircraft
during all phases of ground operations or flight. The “challenge and
response” technique is an excellent way to ensure all required checklist
items are completed during normal or emergency operations. The WSO
should initiate the appropriate checklist, confirm the action with the pilot,
and then ensure the action is completed correctly.

Advisement

Communication of actions or intended actions between cockpits is an
absolute necessity for effective employment of the F-15E. Many tasks
in both cockpits are very time critical and taking command of a display or
changing a master mode at the wrong time can greater affect the outcome
of a mission and cause confusion in both cockpits. Excellent examples of
this are when the pilot takes command of the radar just as the WSO is
trying to designate the target or changes of set clearance planes during
TFR operations without advising the WSO. In either case, the actions
may cause distractions and detract from what the aircrew is trying to
accomplish. Effective communication will solve this problem if both
aircrew advise each other of any deviation from briefed duties and
acknowledge any actions or deviations.
