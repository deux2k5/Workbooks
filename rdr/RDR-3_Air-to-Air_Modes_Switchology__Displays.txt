GUNS auto locks in MPRF out to 15 nm. SS, BST and VTS auto lock in
MPRF out to 10 nm. Long range boresight auto locks in interleaved PRF
out to 40 nm. The minimum range for the auto acq modes is 500 feet,
except for GUNS and LR BST, which is 3000 feet due to a longer pulse
width.

It is necessary to be in search or to reject any previous target lock before
selecting an auto acq mode. Weapons select switch position has no effect
on selecting SS, BST, LR BST and VTS with the FCP auto acq switch.
Forward and release once within one second on the FCP auto acq switch
selects supersearch. Forward (in less than one second) twice and release
selects boresight. Forward and hold on the auto acq switch for one second
or longer selects long range boresight. Aft for less than one second on the
auto acq switch selects vertical scan (Figure D-4, left). The pilot activates
the GUNS mode by selecting it on the throttle weapon select switch
(Figure D-4, right). Auto acq modes selected on the FCP stick (auto acq
switch) have priority over the GUNS mode and over any other radar
search mode. When selecting auto acq modes from the FCP stick, the scan
patterns continue until target acquisition or mode rejection. The GUNS
auto acq scan pattern will continue until target acquisition, initiation of
another auto acq mode or movement of the weapons select switch out of
the GUN position. Once lock on occurs from any mode, the pilot may
select any air-to-air weapon/attack steering display.

Supersearch

When activating supersearch, the radar searches a 20° x 20° area depicted
in the HUD by a 20° reference circle (Figure D-5). The scan is an aircraft
stabilized, six-bar pattern centered 4° below the waterline symbol and is
used to enhance lock-on capability during F-15E target maneuvering. The
first target detected within this pattern is automatically acquired and
tracked. It is difficult to selectively lock a particular target when multiple
targets are in the FOV of supersearch.

The SS scan center initializes in the HUD center (-4° below waterline) and
can be elevated/depressed up/down center to +28° or -19° via a full
up/down action on the FCP TDC. There are no intermediate positions.
This results in a corresponding scan shift that provides “vertical scan”
capability with the benefit of SS area coverage (Figure D-6).

SUPERSEARCH "DOWN"

Figure D - 6. Positionable SS.

The SS half circle down picture in the HUD represents the radar scan
coverage fairly accurately. However, the half circle up picture can be
misleading. 28° up center from the waterline places the radar scan
completely above the HUD. In fact, think of the up center scan pattern as
“sitting on top of the canopy bow.” This creates a SS blank area of +6° to
+18° (effectively from the top of the HUD to the canopy bow) that cannot
be used for acquisition.

Boresight

BST slaves the antenna to the radar boresight line (RBL)(W) and
initiates an auto acquisition range search along the antenna LOS. The

4° BST reference circle on the HUD (Figure D-7) allows the pilot to
maintain the target within the BST scan pattern and provides a rapid and
highly discriminating lock on capability.

Text from RDR-3_Air-to-Air_Modes_Switchology__Displays_page_14.jpeg:
Long Range Boresight

Long range boresight auto acq mode acquires long range targets located
along the RBL (pilot sees a contrail and wants to lock on with an auto acq
mode). Once again, the radar slaves the antenna to the RBL and initiates
an auto acq range search along the antenna LOS from 3000 feet out to

40 nm. The radar continues in auto acq search until it acquires a target
or the crew commands return to search. A 2.5° reference circle is
displayed on the HUD to approximate search pattern coverage (Figure
D-8).

When entering LR BST from SS, the radar enters BST at initial actuation
of the auto acq switch and then enters LR BST when the pilots holds the
switch for 1 second or longer. When entering LR BST from any other
mode, the radar enters SS and then goes to LR BST when the pilot holds
the switch for 1 second or longer. If the radar achieves track before the
pilot holds the switch for 1 second or longer, it remains in STT.

During LR BST, the radar range scale changes to 40 nm. Ifthe crew exits
LR BST to search (mode reject), the radar returns to the selected range
scale.

Vertical Scan

In VTS, the radar searches from 5° to 55° above RBL and 7.5° in azimuth.
The vertical scan reference line on the HUD (Figure D-9) provides the
pilot with an aiming reference to help bring the target within the radar
scan pattern. This scan pattern starts at the top of the HUD (top of the
line) and goes up to +55°. This mode affords fairly rapid and selective
auto acquisition of visual targets positioned along the aircraft’s lift vector.
As an example, to auto lock a bandit spotted at about 1-2 o’clock level,
thumb aft and release on the auto acq switch, and roll 90° right to place
him above the HUD and on an imaginary extended VTS line of the HUD
(above the center mirror is a useful reference (Figure D-10)).

GUNS Mode

The GUNS auto acq radar scan pattern covers a large volume of airspace
(60° in azimuth, 20° in elevation) and is space stabilized to the INS
horizon (Figure D-11). When initialized by selecting GUN on the weapon
select switch (not in STT or DTWS), the scan centers on 0° AZ

(aircraft W )/EL (INS horizon), but the pilot may slew via the TDC to the
AZ/EL limits of the radar. Displayed altitude coverage data on the radar
display is based on a fixed 7.5 nm range. The pilot changes elevation and
azimuth angles by moving the acquisition symbol up/down and left/right,
respectively, on the A/A radar display. Excessive look angles (i.e.
acquisition symbols well above/below the center of the scope) give a false
picture of actual radar coverage. After selection of GUN but prior to
acquisition of a target inside 15 nm, the radar displays targets detected
between 15 and 20 nm. These targets cannot be acquired with manual or
auto lock while still in GUN. The pilot can select all other auto acq modes
during the GUNS scan (i.e., they will take precedence over GUNS scan).

Mode reject reinitializes the scan center to 0° AZ (aircraft w= / EL (INS
horizon) while in GUNS search. If the radar locks and the pilot then
selects mode reject, the radar initiates “bump” acquisition. During bump
acquisition, the radar breaks lock, positions the scan center 5° right and
1.7° down from the original target, and resumes the GUNS scan.

SINGLE TARGET TRACK (STT) AND PRF TRACK TRANSFER

The primary function of single target track is to provide target data
required for accurate weapon delivery. The STT mode utilizes three
semi-independent tracking loops in its calculations: one for angle, one for
velocity and one for range. The radar tracks the target in angle and
velocity during HPRF. In MPRF, the radar tracks the target in angle,
velocity and range. MPRF ranging is more accurate than the FM ranging
employed in HPRF; however, AIM-7s require HPRF illumination of the
target for proper guidance.

If acquisition occurs in HPRF (“HI” in radar BIT window), the radar
attempts to switch to MPRF. At target ranges beyond the MPRF
capability, the radar performs FM ranging every % second (using the
HPRF waveform) to provide an approximate target range. Inside 40 nm,
the radar attempts MPRF ranging every 3 seconds. When MPRF ranging
is successful (target is detected in MPRF), the radar stops FM ranging,
but continues to track in HPRF. Inside 30 nm, the radar transfers to
MPRF track (“MED” in radar BIT window). The exact range is a function
of target size and signal strength. Selecting MRM and MASTER ARM
does not prevent the transfer to MPRF, unless maximum AIM-7 launch
range is outside of 30 nm. This may be the case if the F-15E is at medium
or high altitude, or the target is extremely high and fast.

While tracking a target in MPRF with master arm (ARM, MRM selected
and an AIM-7 in priority), the radar attempts to transfer back to HPRF
when target range is less than 1.2 Raero (Raero is based on MRM
aerodynamic range) for frontal aspect targets and 1.05 Raero for rear
aspect targets. HPRF track transfer from MPRF final track takes 1.5 to
2 seconds. However, it may never occur against a beam aspect or co-speed
tail aspect target. Maneuver to move the target out of the main beam
clutter, or accelerate/decelerate to shift its doppler away from the altitude
line. This may allow the radar to upgrade to HPRF final track for AIM-7
launch. With an AIM-120 in priority, the radar continuously attempts to
transfer to MPRF when target range is less than 30 nm.

TRACK DISPLAYS

In STT, the radar provides target range, range rate, velocity, antenna
angles, and angular rates to the central computer (CC) for computation of
weapon attack mode parameters. Once lock on occurs (either manual or
auto acq), the track display presented is a function of the weapon select
switch position. The parameters displayed include: target true airspeed,
aspect angle, magnetic heading, altitude, heading vector, range and range
rate (opening/closing velocity between fighter and target, or Vc).

Figures D-12 through D-19 depict a sequence of track displays from initial
lock through break X (weapon select switch: MRM/SRM/GUN). Aspect
angle (AA) is the angle from the tail of the target measured around to the
radar line of sight from the fighter and is displayed in degrees divided by
10 (15 aspect angle equals 150°). An L or R following the aspect angle
indicates which side of the target you are seeing. Altitude appears
adjacent to the antenna elevation caret and above the star in thousands of
feet. At the elevation caret, the dash between the first digit(s) and the
last digit represents a decimal point; thus, 20-1 represents 20,100 feet. A
caret on the right side of the display indicates range. Vc appears left of
the range caret. The vector stick indicates target heading relative to the
center scribe line (fighter heading) and will move if the target maneuvers.
Bearing and range to the tracked target from the selected bullseye point
appears to the right of fighter ground speed.

NOTE

The heading vector oscillates 10° to 20° (or more) in STT when there are
multiple targets in the radar beam.

ASE Circle/Steering Dot

The ASE circle and steering dot relate lead angle error (LAE). The circle
represents the maximum steering error that is normally acceptable for
missile launch. The pilot should maneuver the aircraft to position the
steering dot inside the circle.

Text from RDR-3_Air-to-Air_Modes_Switchology__Displays_page_21.jpeg:
MRM Range Symbols

The Raero, Ropt, Rpi, Rmnvr, Rtr and Rmin symbols display when radar
track exists in MRM. Your aircraft velocity is assumed constant
throughout the pickle to separation time for computation of all zones.
Steering dot centered is assumed for computation of the displayed Raero
and Ropt; actual (current) steering limited to the maximum size of the
ASE circle is used for all other zone calculations. Refer to

TO 1F-15E-34-1-1-1 for additional parameters used in determining missile
ranges.

Raero (Maximum Aerodynamic Range)

Raero, indicated by a triangle, is the absolute maximum missile launch
range and is calculated using optimal ownship steering, including lofting.
This zone assumes that the target executes no maneuver (i.e., current
velocity is assumed constant).

The first time a target intercept can be computed taking into account
Raero constraints and current steering errors is known as Raero (current).
The presence of the shoot cue indicates that Raero (current) has been
reached.

Ropt (Maximum Range Probability of Intercept with Optimum Steering)

Ropt, indicated by a circle, is a special case of Rpi calculated assuming
steering dot centered in the ASE circle (optimal steering) and is the same
as Rpi in other respects. This zone assumes that the target executes no
maneuver (i.e., current velocity is assumed constant with no acceleration).

For AIM-7s, Ropt cannot be greater than the calculated dynamic seeker
range. DSR is not displayed.

Rpi (Maximum Range Probability of Intercept with Current Steering)

Rpi is the maximum launch range with current steering that assures a
high likelihood of success. This zone assumes that the target executes no
maneuver (i.e., current velocity is assumed constant with no acceleration).
As the pilot optimizes the steering by centering the dot in the ASE circle,
current steering closely approaches optimal steering, and Rpi approaches
Ropt. With the dot centered, Rpi and Ropt are the same.

For AIM-7s, Rpi cannot be greater than the calculated dynamic seeker
range. DSR is not displayed.

D-15 RDR-3


Text from RDR-3_Air-to-Air_Modes_Switchology__Displays_page_22.jpeg:
Rmnvr (Maximum Launch Range Against a Maneuvering Target)

Rmnvr (indicated by the sideways golf tee shaped symbol) represents the
maximum launch range against a target executing a constant speed, level,
4-¢ turn towards the tail at launch, to a designated aspect angle as
entered on the ARMT (Top Level PACS Menu, PB #16) display or via
MC/DTM. Ifthe current target aspect is less than the entered target
aspect (i.e., closer to tail aspect), then Rmnvr equals Rpi. Entering 180°
aspect (OFF displayed at PB #16) inhibits computation and display of
Rmnvr since it is impossible to turn towards the tail and be at a head
aspect when the turn is complete. Refer to TO 1F-15E-34-1-1-1.

Rtr (Range Turn and Run)

Rtr indicates the maximum launch range against a target executing an
evasive turn and run maneuver at launch and is calculated assuming
current ownship steering. A vertical line connects Rtr and Rmin. The
target turn capability is based on F-15E specific power (Ps) curves under
the following conditions.

F100-PW-229 engines
Clean aircraft

50% fuel remaining
Maximum power
Standard day

This zone assumes that the target executes a maximum g level maneuver
with instantaneous g onset in the shortest direction to tail aspect; target
speed is assumed constant until the target reaches tail aspect, and then
increases per the capability in the conditions listed above.

RDR-3 D-16


Text from RDR-3_Air-to-Air_Modes_Switchology__Displays_page_23.jpeg:
Rmin (Minimum Launch Range)

Rmin is the minimum launch range that assures any likelihood of success.
Target accelerations are assumed constant for the Rmin TOF. Your
aircraft velocity is assumed constant throughout the pickle to separation
time.

MRM Digital Maneuvering Cue (DMC)

The DMC appears just below the target Vc when the target range is less
than or equal to Rpi and greater than or equal to Rtr. The cue indicates
the maximum number of degrees the target can turn in the shortest
direction towards the tail without defeating the priority missile for the
current conditions. The target maneuver is a level 4-g turn initiated at
pickle; target speed is constant. The radar displays a T when:

e the target aspect is tail, or
e a target turn to tail will not defeat the priority missile.

TOF/TTA/TTI

Predicted TOF/TTA displays between Raero (current) and Rmin with the
steering dot inside the ASE circle. TOF/TTA updates for changes in target
radar angle and range. For AIM-7 missiles, the letter “T” precedes this
TOF to indicate time to impact. For AIM-120, time without any preceding
letter indicates time to active after launch. If the letter “H” or “M”
precedes this time, then the AIM-120 missile is already inside active
range.

If target azimuth exceeds 45° right or left in STT, the radar goes into an

TRACK-WHILE-SCAN (TWS)

TWS is a mode that affords a near all-aspect, multi-target detection and
track capability within a selected area. TWS can provide the “big picture”
via rapid altitude sampling between targets, wide volume search and a
plan view of target formations with heading vectors. Track data is made
available with reduced effect on target RWR. In addition, TWS furnishes
a situational picture for high confidence final sorts.

There are two different TWS rates and two different TWS modes
available. The TWS rates are normal rate TWS (NTWS) and high data
rate TWS (HDTWS). In NTWS, frame time varies from 2.2 to 2.6 seconds,
and three scan patterns are available: 2 bar, 60° azimuth; 4 bar, 30°
azimuth; and 6 bar, 15° azimuth. In HDTWS, two scan patterns are
available: 3 bar/30° and 2 bar/30°. Frame time is 1.5 seconds in 3 bar
HDTWS and 1 second in 2 bar HDTWS.

Designated TWS (DTWS) mode or nondesignated TWS (NDTWS) mode
can use either of the two rates. Designated TWS ties the scan pattern
around a primary designated target (PDT), which provides detailed
information on that target, and also maintains track files on other targets.
In NDTWS, the scan pattern is not tied to any target. (The search pattern
can be positioned to the radar and elevation scan limits).

TWS selection is inhibited if GUN is selected on the weapon select switch,

TWS Rates

From search, depress and release the FCP TDC or go full action on the
RCP trigger, and thumb aft on the FCP auto acq/RCP mode reject switch
to select NTWS or auto acq forward for greater than or equal to 1 second
or less than 1 second selects different versions of HDTWS (see Figure
D-20 and D-21). From STT, thumb aft on the auto acq/mode reject switch
to enable NTWS. To enter HDTWS from STT, thumb forward greater
than or equal to 1 second or less than 1 second on the auto acq/mode reject
switch. To enter STT from either HDTWS or NTWS, thumb aft on the
auto acq.

TWS Modes

Whenever the crew enters TWS from search (or if all targets are manually
undesignated), the radar operates in NDTWS mode. If the crew initiates
TWS from STT (or if the crew designates a track file in NDTWS by placing
the acq symbol over the track file and pressing the FCP TDC/RCP
trigger), the radar enters DTWS operation with a track file established
from the designated target (STT) data. Thus it is possible to alternate
between NDTWS and DTWS.

Positioning the weapon select switch to GUN (in DTWS) also causes the
radar to enter STT. When the pilot selects GUN during NDTWS, the
radar enters the auto acq GUNS mode. Note, depressing the auto acq
switch (except in GUNS) eventually returns the radar to search.

Scan Patterns

Normal TWS (Designated or Nondesignated)

When the crew initiates NTWS, three AZ/EL scan parameters are
selectable: 2 bar, 60°; 4 bar, 30°; and 6 bar, 15° TWS patterns respectively
(Figure D-22). Az bumping is available to select between 2 bar, 60° and

4 bar, 30°. To select 6 bar, 15° position the acq symbol into the radar BIT
window. The word “NARROW” will then appear in the BIT window.
When “NARROW?” is present, designate by pressing FCP TDC/RCP
trigger, the scan becomes 6 bar, 15°. Az bumping changes from 6 bar, 15°
to 4 bar, 30°. When the radar is in TWS, the radar BIT window reflects
the number of bars of the elevation scan (2, 4 or 6) followed by the
acronym “TWS,” followed by the PRF in which the radar is operating

(H for HPRF, M for MPRF, blank for interleaved PRF). As an example, if
the radar is in 2 bar, 60° azimuth scan, medium PRF track-while-scan,
the BIT window would reflect “2TWSM.” Range scale switching also
operates the same as in normal search (via the TDC).

The el wheel controls the elevation scan center in NDTWS. The
acquisition symbol position determines the azimuth scan center. As the
crew moves the scan pattern off the NDTWS targets, the track files go half
intensity. If the files enter track memory (i.e., begin flashing), moving the
search pattern back to cover the target AZ/EL position before or during
flashing should update and retain the track files.

In DTWS, the radar automatically controls the elevation and azimuth
scan center to accommodate the designated target(s) and other track file
targets. Lower priority targets are deleted when all detected targets
cannot be maintained within the elevation or azimuth coverage.

The crew can override DTWS azimuth scan logic by positioning the acq
symbol left or right. Once the crew shifts the scan position in this
manner, the radar automatically maintains only the primary designated
target. The radar automatically recenters the az scan center with any
subsequent target redesignation or azimuth bump.

DTWS elevation scan logic may be biased up or down in 4 and 6 bar TWS
by normal antenna elevation HOTAS. The radar BIT window will
indicate “UTWS” for up bias and “DTWS” for down bias. Designated
targets will be retained in coverage.

HDTWS (Figure D-23) is available in 2 bar/30° and 3 bar/30° scan
patterns. The faster data gathering (frame time) provides an increased
capability against maneuvering targets. AZ bumping in HDTWS will take
you to 2 bar/60° NTWS. When in HDTWS, the radar BIT window reflects
2 HDT and 3 HDT to indicate 2 bar or 3 bar respectively.

Target Processing

The radar maintains track files (in terms of range, angle and rate) on up
to 10 targets and supplies this data to the CC for correlation and update
on an end of frame basis. The first hit produces an observation target (up
to 20 of them) at the end of that frame. Observation targets are deleted if
they do not receive a second hit within the next two frames (NTWS), or
the next three frames (HDTWS). Targets that receive 4 hits become
established track file targets, and are displayed with a relative heading
vector.

All established track file targets abide by the following logic:

e Targets at ranges greater than 20 nm or less than 10 nm that have not
been updated for 10 seconds are deleted (full intensity for 6 seconds,
and then flash for 4 seconds).

e At ranges between 10 nm and 20 nm, a 15 second timer is used (11
seconds full intensity, 4 seconds flashing).

When track file range is beyond (not more than 10 nm beyond) the
displayed range scale, these track files are maintained unless outside of
radar coverage. If all the designated targets are deleted, the radar enters
NDTWS.

Once a target has an established track file, it remains on the display and
moves in a predicted direction based on the latest target hit. Thus, TWS
can provide increased situational awareness through continuously
displayed target information compared to the intermittent display of
normal search.

Target Displays
NDTWS

The NDTWS display (Figure D-24) is similar to the standard A/A search
display. The bar number readout indicates the number of bars in the
selected scan pattern, rather than the current bar number as in normal
search. When the crew selects HDTWS, HDT (i.e., HDTWS) follows the
bar number. TWS track files begin as observation targets (half intensity
symbol).

Other target symbols are unique to the TWS display. Full intensity
symbols with a relative heading vector indicate those targets for which the
radar has sufficient correlation to maintain a track file and are inside the
current scan coverage. Target altitude displays above track files with
vector status. During NDTWS, the radar computer ranks the track file
targets based on first merge criteria (aspect, range and velocity). The
target determined to be the first merged target is called the radar priority
target (RPT). A strobe of six open box symbols denotes angle only (AO)

track file targets. (Further discussion of AO and jamming targets will be
provided in RDR-6.)

Placing the acquisition symbol over a short vector target (in NDTWS or
DTWS) moves the altitude readout to the left of the acq symbols and
target Mach number (if Mach <0.4 or 21.1) displays to the right. The
vector stick will increase in length to a long vector.

DTWS

The crew may designate up to eight TWS targets (track or observation)
via normal lock-on procedures. One designated target will be the primary
designated target (PDT). The seven other TWS designated targets will be
secondary designated targets (SDTs). After entry into DTWS (at least one
target is designated initially), auto designation of all targets with vector
status is possible by boxing “AUTO” at PB #10. Once designated, a target
receives a long heading vector (Figure D-26). If you observe a high
interest track file, and 8 targets have already been designated, one of
those targets must be undesignated prior to designating the new file. To
do this, slew the acquisition symbols over a lower priority designated
target, and thumb aft on the FCP boat switch, or thumb left on the RCP
castle switch (Figure D-25). (If the crew undesignates all targets in this
manner, the radar enters NDTWS.)

The crew can move the PDT status to other SDTs via quick step.
Momentary activation of quick step moves the PDT status to other SDTs
in this order (you cannot quick step to nondesignated TWS targets):

e The SDT next farther out in range

e Ifthe current PDT is farthest in range, then the left most AO SDT,
and then left to right through the designated AO SDT

e Ifthe current PDT is an AO track target farthest right in azimuth
(i.e., lowest ranking), then the shortest range SDT becomes the PDT

Any SDT can be made the PDT by quick pick. Quick pick is accomplished
by redesignating (less than one second) an SDT. That SDT then becomes
the PDT.

When the crew removes the PDT status from a designated target by quick
step or quick pick, the target reverts to an SDT.

TWS SORT

The TWS sort mode enables the crew to see “raw” MPRF target hits
superimposed over a half intensity DTWS or NDTWS display. The legend
at PB #9 on a TWS display is SORT. Select SORT (box) at PB #9 to enter
the TWS SORT mode. For a complete discussion of the mode refer to

TO 1F-15E-34-1-1.

Dual Target Track (DTT)

This TWS mode allows a two-target track capability of two widely spaced
targets—a PDT and SDT. Independent scan patterns (2 mini frames) are
used to track these two targets. These mini frames consist of two mini
rasters of 4 bars with 4.5° azimuth, and 1.5° elevation bar spacing each.
To enter DTT from DTWS, redesignate a secondary designated target for
longer than 1 second. There are several options for exiting DTT. For
more information, refer to TO 1F-15E-34-1-1.

SEARCH SORT

Sort is a 30°, space-stabilized search scan (Figure D-27) that assists in
rapid detection of closely spaced targets. The acquisition symbol and scan
pattern stay pointed at the proper volume of space (within gimbal limits)
to reduce crew workload during maneuvers. If the antenna reaches
gimbal limits during this process, the 30° search continues at that limit.
Azimuth bumping does not occur without moving the TDC. Elevation
bars used are changed automatically according to radar range scale
selected, and are not as selected at PB #2, “EL” control.

D-41 RDR-3


Text from RDR-3_Air-to-Air_Modes_Switchology__Displays_page_48.jpeg:
Sort is selectable during search or STT. The scan centers at the
acquisition symbol when entered from search. The crew selects sort from
search by depressing the FCP TDC or going full action on the RCP trigger
for more than one second. It is not possible to enter sort via azimuth
bumping, or from auto acq or flood. When the crew selects MODE
REJECT from auto acq lock, flood or STT, the radar initializes to the sort
mode.

If the crew initiates sort while in STT, the radar breaks lock and the scan
centers on the tracked target. If the crew initiates sort while in HOJ or
HOJ track extrapolate, the radar enters sort scan centered on the
jammer’s az/el position. Sort scan locus is adjustable through normal
controls for azimuth, elevation and range. The radar automatically
controls bar spacing and the number of bars as a function of the radar
range scale.

This sort mode is not the same as the TWS SORT mode presented earlier
in this workbook.

RDR-3 D - 42


Text from RDR-3_Air-to-Air_Modes_Switchology__Displays_page_49.jpeg:
FLOOD
Manual Selection-MPRF

If lock on by the preferred methods cannot be obtained, MPRF flood mode
can be manually selected via PB #13 on the MPD/MPCD. The FLOOD
command from PB #18 is ignored in STT, TWS, or BIT. The main
antenna drives to a 60° look-down angle (to clear the path for the flood
antenna) and the flood antenna output is energized (MPRF). The FLOOD
cue appears below PB #19. This mode can provide backup air-to-air gun
ranging (out to 2 nm) for the nearest target within flood range and flood
antenna beamwidth. MPRF flood ranging is used with the LCOS track
funnel gunsight display in the HUD.

Manual Selection—-HPRF

If the radar is in STT or DTWS, the pilot can manually select HPRF flood
illumination at AIM-7 missile launch by holding the FCP coolie switch
down prior to and while pressing the pickle button.

The crew can also manually select HPRF flood illumination after an
AIM-7 launch in STT by pressing aft on the auto acq switch for greater
than 1 second.

Automatic Selection—HPRF

Flood horn HPRF radiation is automatically provided at certain times
during AIM-7 operations. HPRF flood is automatically provided at AIM-7
launch if the radar is in search. Auto flood also occurs during HPRF track
extrapolate (memory) operations if the target is inside of flood antenna
range and FOV, or if HPRF track is not achieved within 1 second of
launch initiation from STT, or 3 seconds from DTWS.

The radar attempts a confirmed HPRF track upgrade within % second of
launch initiation from MPRF final track or HPRF probationary track. If
unsuccessful, HPRF flood illumination activates. The launch-to-eject cycle
is not delayed.

The launch cycle delays for up to 3 seconds when the MRM fire signal
occurs during DTWS operation. If the radar does not achieve HPRF STT
within this 3 second period, the radar initiates flood illumination for
missile launch. The radar does not delay HPRF FLOOD at launch when
targets are within the FOV at less than 5 nm in the front and 3 nm in the
stern.

HPRF flood illumination is effective to approximately 8 nm, depending on
target size. As in manual HPRF flood operations, the HUD is the primary
attack reference. The pilot steers to maintain the target within the 12°
MRM reference circle during the AIM-7 fly out.

Any activation of the auto acq switch suspends automatic flood ops and
commands the selected mode. (GUNS scan does not interrupt flood.)

Refer to TO 1F-15E-34-1-1-1 for additional information.
Velocity Search Boresight (VS BST) Mode

The VS BST mode provides HPRF AIM-7 illumination similar to the
FLOOD mode except that VS BST uses the main antenna. The radar
enters VS BST when the auto acq switch is pressed forward for greater
than one second while the radar is supporting an AIM-7 shot. VS BST

TEXT

The APG-70 is a coherent, multiple PRF, multi-mode attack radar. It has
the capability to search for, acquire and track airborne targets as well as
provide air-to-ground mapping and ranging. The radar set, in concert
with TEWS indications, provides the aircrew with the options of threat
avoidance, engagement and air-to-surface mission accomplishment.
Several operational modes and multiple radar features assist in air-to-air
weapons employment.

(To enhance readability, some information has been omitted from the
radar and HUD displays throughout this workbook. Switchology
presentations assume crewmember is in command of the air-to-air radar
display.)

TARGET ACQUISITION
Manual Acquisition

Manual radar lock on (target designation or acquisition) is typically
employed in an intercept environment at medium to long range. In
search, use the TDC to bracket (enclose) the target with the acquisition
symbol (Figure D-1). This is done by pressing the TDC left/right/up/down
to move the acquisition symbol, likewise on the radar display.

Text from RDR-3_Air-to-Air_Modes_Switchology__Displays_page_8.jpeg:
Depressing and releasing the FCP TDC commands the radar to enter a
+8° azimuth acquisition scan (miniraster) centered on the acquisition
symbol in azimuth and search the selected bar pattern in elevation. (Two
bar initially and then the selected bar pattern after 1.5 seconds.)
Releasing the TDC allows manual lock on or acquisition (STT), if the acq
symbol is bracketing a target. Full action and release on the RCP
handcontroller trigger commands miniraster. Releasing the trigger allows
lock on, if the acq symbol is bracketing a target (Figure D-2). Ifthe pilot
does not release the FCP TDC (WSO/RCP trigger) within one second, the
radar enters search sort mode. Normally for a single target, depress and
release the TDC/trigger in one action (< 1 sec) with the acquisition symbol
on the target.

Text from RDR-3_Air-to-Air_Modes_Switchology__Displays_page_9.jpeg:
If the radar does not achieve lock on (no target within the acq symbol or
the radar is unable to acquire), the scan remains in miniraster in the bar
scan selected (never less than two). Push down on the FCP/RCP auto
acquisition switch (mode reject) to return to search and attempt to
reacquire, if desired (Figure D-3). If the radar achieves lock on, mode
reject also returns to search. Mode reject also clears the radar display of
false targets (“birds”).

Auto Acquisition (Auto Acq)

There are several radar auto acq modes: supersearch (SS), boresight
(BST), long range boresight (LR BST), vertical scan (VTS) and GUNS.
These modes are only selectable from the front cockpit (assumes the pilot
has command of the A/A radar display). These modes place the radar into
a specific scan pattern, prepared for auto acquisition. When the pilot
points the aircraft so that the target enters the radar scan pattern, the
radar automatically acquires (locks on) the target. The pilot will normally
point the aircraft by visual reference to the target. Additionally, SS, BST,
LR BST and VTS are aircraft stabilized, while GUNS is INS horizon
stabilized vertically and aircraft stabilized horizontally.
